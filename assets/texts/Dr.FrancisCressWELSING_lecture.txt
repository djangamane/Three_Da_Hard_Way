got her same vibe you coming through here i mean we are so honored to have you um this is the best birthday present
i could have ever received i kid you now i feel like a little kid now i'm so happy i'm blessed you know i mean
i could go out there oh no it's my boring day's my day this is the best birthday present i have i've ever
received and without any further ado dr frank scripture
[Applause]
so
[Applause]
good afternoon everyone i am really honored to be here and to
have been invited uh by shahbaz wilson and clemson brown
i haven't been in new york in a long time but i'm thrilled to be here and
happy birthday thank you and many more
i'm going to as usual talk about racism white supremacy
my mother is deceased but one time she said to me what are you going to talk about francis
and i said mother you know i only talk about racism and she said well can't you talk about
something different but everything is racism
and i want to talk about it i'm a general psychiatrist and child psychiatrist
practicing in washington dc and i have arrived at the point where i feel
that the most important thing that we as black people need to understand
is this powerful dynamic of racism those of you who are familiar with the
work of nealy fuller know that he has said
if you do not understand white supremacy racism
what it is and exactly how it works everything else that you think you
understand will only confuse you so i believe that if we are going to
move further into the 21st century and into the 22nd century and into the
23rd century that we have to have
clear insight as to what this process is all about
i think it's in the book of isaiah if you do not have those who do not have
a vision if if there's no vision the people will perish i guess that's if there is no
vision the people will perish meaning we have to have
a more global understanding of exactly what the forces are on this planet so we
can actually do short-range planning as well as
long-range planning i started thinking about racism when i was doing a
residency in general psychiatry at st elizabeth's hospital in washington
d.c and it was a program that was based on freudian psychoanalytic theory
and nothing was really being said about the mental health of black people
i'm a third generation physician my father was a physician his father was a physician
and my parents told us that you were getting an education
not to leave your community you were getting an education in order
to help your community right so the black patients
that i would talk to and take a history on within the history of every black
patient would be aspects and dimensions of racism
and when i was an undergrad i considered myself to be a marxist i
thought that economics was causing racism that it was a means for economic
exploitation where you can have ideas as an undergrad
but when you are a physician and responsible for the care of patients
you really have to know what you're talking about i remember going home
when i was an undergrad you know my parents and my grandmother were
sitting at the dining room table and i announced i'm a marxist
and my grandmother said the more education they get the dumber thing
but anyway talking to patients
and seeing this gigantic monster in the middle of their history about racism
i said i've got to really understand racism and death and the training program that i was in
it was at a federal government hospital all the people in charge of the training program were white people
and they actually taught us there were a few black residents i think three
out of 12 that black people did not have the intellectual potential
to benefit from psychotherapy that the best treatment for black people
was medication well that did not compute for me so i said out to myself
i want to understand really more about racism
i happen to have been at a social gathering and these were black people sitting
around after a black power committee meeting and i heard a gentleman across the room
say racism is a system it was almost like a light bulb going on
that was nearly full or how many of you are familiar with his work i consider him to be one of the critical
thinkers in our group in the 20th century and into the 21st
century he was saying that racism is a system and let me
because we got to get this really in our heads he said it was a system
and the system functions in all areas of people activity economics
education entertainment labor
law politics religion
sex and war and that the purpose of this system
is to maintain the power equation of white over non-white white power over
non-white powerlessness and so i thought this was a very profound
concept those of you who are familiar with the work of dr du bois dr du bois
in 1903 said that the problem of the 20th century
is the question of the color line this is the problem
of the color lines so i said to myself
why would a system
for the purpose of maintaining white power over non-white powerlessness
why would such a system evolve on this particular planet planet
earth and then i thought about some of the things that are said within
the system one of the critical things is that we are taught that white
is a majority is that right
and we are told that non-white is
genetic inferior and then i just thought about the things
that you know you learned going to school for a long time and going to medical school
i said wait a minute why is a tiny minority
fewer than one-tenth of the people on the planet have white skins
and instead of black people being genetically inferior
the ability to produce this black pigment melanin
is a genetically dominant trait
and we have an excellent example in our president
barack obama his mother is white
was quite his father was black and you mix these together and what do
you get a person
see always a black person so i said that okay on this planet
planet earth in the 15th century we had columbus
1492. coming out of europe
and realizing that the earth was round and not flat and everywhere these white people landed
they found colored people right and if those men
were sexually frustrated and the people were over time
and they the women had sex or i should say that men have sex
imposed sex however you want to look at it if they waited around nine months
they found that all of the children looked like
the mothers and so they realized
wait a minute we are a tiny minority in europe and no other place where there
are white people so they said wait a minute what if these
men got in votes
and started going from south to north
we could genetically disappear now this may not make sense to black
people because under white supremacy black people try to get rid of their color
don't we white people don't want to disappear
and i have asked audiences of white people do you want your children to become
do you want your grandchildren to be covered do you want your
great-grandchildren to be colored do you want your
[Music] great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren to be colored i'm polite and they're polite what do
they say no meaning they don't want to disappear
so i said if you mean this then you have to do certain specific
things in all of these areas of activity
so that white does not disappear on planet earth
now unbeknownst to us this is the critical underlying
motivation for all of the behavior of people who
classify themselves as white on this planet
i don't know how many of you are familiar with the name tom mexter
he was one of the is one of the arch white supremacists of white separatists
some years ago i was on a television program in los angeles when
president reagan's son had a television talk show
and so this particular show was a panel of people
rather than 10 people talking about race and racism
i just happened to be sitting next to mr metzker
and so during a commercial break i kind of touched him on his arm i'm sitting right next to him
and he didn't say don't touch me [ __ ] i said mr mester tell me something
what percentage of people who classify themselves as
white are fearful of white genetic annihilation
and he answered very politely he said dr wells seen nearly all of them
but they are ashamed they were afraid to admit it now i can understand that in other words
this system is about quite
genetic survival
now if some people have organized the system for their genetic survival
what's the chance that they're going to give that system up
see they worked hard and we can consider it unjust it's the
most unjust system that has ever been devised on the planet
where you have one-tenth of the people deciding that they need to control
nine-tenths of the people on the planet
but all along i maintain we have not understood this
we thought when we were formerly enslaved if they would just take off the chains
everything is going to be okay so they removed the chains and then what
did they do next they put laws in place
to accomplish the same thing and we went through the 1960s in what is
being called the civil rights era and the black people with all of their
dignity and their pride and their courage
going up against horses and hoses and dogs
to get the vote to get that changed coming out of that
movement saying black pride black is beautiful black power black self-respect
and the people who had something else in mind said that's dangerous
if people are talking about self-respect and dignity then i encourage everybody
to look at the film's eye on the prize and look at those black people men and
women and children going up against a horrific force
but they were determined and they had their self-respect with them but the system said
this is dangerous if we let these people go forward
talking about black pride black dignity black is beautiful we will be in trouble
so we have to have something for them and i maintain that's when they decided
well we have to feed them images of superfly
prostitutes pimps selling drugs men kicking women all kind of language
following that up into the present
with having black people call themselves [ __ ]
and dogs and gangsters and thugs and [ __ ] and hoes
that's right now once that's in the brain computer
that's right you can do anything see that's the complete annihilation
of self-respect now we didn't understand it we thought
oh this is just entertainment like the movie monster ball
or the movie precious do you see or the movie for color
[Music]
see girls we don't have a clue we don't have a clue
about what is going on see we we've been thinking
and god bless dr martin luther king a minister but a great political scientist
he said it's about love everybody should love
and he got killed and i say the reason being
that if everybody on the planet all these people
white non-quite loved and the love was expressed in sexual
activity what would happen white would disappear
did you see so kill him
because that would mean our genetic disappearance
so the system is about quite genetic survival
what do they have to worry about most
black men white women right okay but let's even take it further
in that if the concern is quite genetic survival
they don't have to worry about black women why
i'm saying this see the test is gonna be next week
the reason being is that men
males whether they're white black brown red or yellow can impose sexual intercourse
if i would you know try to impose sexual intercourse on any of the gentleman here
and they said i'm sitting next to my wife and i went to my person i got my uzi
and i frightened the man what's going to happen
i hope everybody got that the erection cannot be maintained in the
presence of fear so females cannot impose sexual
intercourse you know like ultimately what
writing the man now the creator made that possible so
somebody if they were in danger they wouldn't be in conflict this is fear i mean fear about
unemployment could cause a man to have erection problems
are you always making it so there's a reason
that if the concern is genetic survival
and see we are decoding this material because we have thought somehow
there's some white people who are going to work with us
sometimes we thought it was republican sometimes we thought you know with lincoln and sometimes democrats
but even president obama is finding out [Music]
it could be republicans or democrats but if it's a black man that they're
being asked to support they start jumping [ __ ]
because the test for white people see they in other words they work 24 7.
they don't sleep they got three shifts going see we work one shift and then go to bed
they work 24 7 about maintaining the conditions for
their survival you see because it is very serious to
them and if they have some people who classify themselves as white
who start looking like they're getting out of line
what's the question that they ask are you a [ __ ] lover
do you see are you with us or are you with them now this is a fundamental question that
has to do with the issue of their survival
so that we cannot depend on communists
conservative liberals dreams libertarians
and see this is not a lecture about hate white people it is a lecture about
understanding the opposition and one of the best analogies to have in
mind is the game of chess
see what is the game of chess about strategy those are nice bc answers
white always moves first so white is playing what our favorite
defense black has to play defense
this is what we have now this is distressing to a lot of people
because we wanted to believe as we were even programmed to believe
in the area of religion
see i don't know how many of you i'm a little bit older than many
but if you went to sunday school my grandfather was chairman of the deacon and trustee board so we were in sunday
school before we could see straight but what did we learn
that god is white can anybody think they didn't learn that
god was white see if you were given that little sunday
school card with a white picture of jesus your brain automatically concluded
that his father had to be white his father could not have been black
now if he was a historic figure he was black even billy graham said that jesus could
not have been white but we are programmed to think
that jesus was white and therefore his father is white
and we were taught to sing jesus translate white man loves the little
children all the little children of the world red yellow black and white
all are precious in his sight how many know that song or no more church going in these
chapters there was a time when everybody knew
those basic songs you see but being taught that god is white and they got a musical
came out some time ago arms too short the box was gone
meaning arms too short to box with the white man
see when i was a little child having seen the sunday school card with jesus on it
i had just drawn my own conclusion that the man on the quaker oats box must
be god [Music] see he was somewhat older with white
hair jesus was younger so you know now we thank him for the food
we just had this big quaker oats box in the pan
i mean that was my conclusion but if you any of you
saw a sunday school car with the white jesus your brain jumped to that conclusion too
without your knowing it that's called a subconscious conclusion
so anyway this was deeply programmed
in our thinking but i tell people that the truth is you cannot hide it
that it will come out in material it will come out through the subconscious
because if we break the name jesus down in ebonics
it spells just us
that's who we're waiting for right just us
to get our heads together and i say that as black people
we greet each other a zillion times a day we're saying hey what's happening
what's happening what's happening because we don't know what's going on
see we keep running into a wall and wondering how come things haven't worked out
because we have been deceived we have been told we are in a democracy
where everybody is equal the truth and the reality is is that we
are in a system of racism white supremacy
see we're told that the system of democracy has imperfections
no we are in a system of white supremacy that has been perfected
and that's why we keep staying basically in the same position
and as long as we don't understand we're dealing with a system
every week we just complain another black man has been shot another black man has been killed
she said oh 10 over there three over there oh well let's add up the statistics and
somebody will run and complain about it but if it's happening over and over
again that implies intentionality
and if the system is about quite genetic survival
who is the enemy of the state
now the black man
see in a war if you can take care of the business as
defined the problem is like genetic survival
so what do you have to knock out in order to not worry about white
genetic survivor
the attack has to center on the black man
now years ago 19 in the 1970s i was teaching at howard university
college of medicine and i would have nearly fuller lecture every monday night
from eight until one o'clock in the morning and it would be students and people from
the community and mr fuller used to talk about
the system of racism white supremacy is going to have black men wearing
dresses and now this is 1970
about 72-73 and that sound is so far out
nobody you know what's he talking about
what has recently happened at morehouse college
the president of morehouse college had to announce and lay down the law
that the black male students those who were so inclined could not
wear high-heeled shoes could not wear dresses and carry pocket
books now this is two zero one zero
that is the system see in other words we have to keep
system about white
genetic survival
this is what the system is about and the system is working 24 7.
turn if i turn the black male into a female
can i relax about the fear of white genetic survival
absolutely now i don't know what goes on here in new york haven't been here in a while
in d.c we have a lot of men with their pants
hanging down in the train station when i bought my
ticket to come here there's a black gentleman had on some expensive clothes
had some nice luggage his pants were down here
so he would pull the luggage like this after he got his ticket and then he had to stop
imagine somebody looking down from another galaxy or planet that's right
you see in other words psychiatrist behavior all behavior has significance
you just have to understand the context and the power that is controlling it
this is what i'm saying so to understand what is happening
because what are we told seventy percent of the households
are without fire
read a book recently where a young black man is talking about having gotten into some difficulty doing a
carjacking carrying a gun at 16. and he said in the book
i had to go to prison to find my fathers
he said father he said in prison was the first time he had an opportunity
now he didn't consciously put himself in that situation but looking for fathers
i had a black male child say to me you know somebody brings a child to the
psychiatrist because he's not studying or something i had one child say to me who was about
10 or 11 years old dr welsing i think i could do my
homework if i just had an official father now that makes a psychiatrist want to
fall under the destiny and start crying i had another child say
if i had a father he could at least have taught me what goes on under the hood of
a car i had another child all these children
are brought into the psychiatrist because somebody says teacher principal
they're smart but they won't do their homework or they won't study
this child came and i said sweetheart don't you want to
work hard in school this is years ago
so you can help black people and this little boy said no
he wasn't being smart alec he wasn't being rude and i said you know the psychiatrist
wants to hear the child say yes he said no and i said why not
he said if you try to help black people
you're going to be killed now this is a little black child about
11 years old said malcolm x george jackson
i said iq 265.
if you try to help black people you are going to be killed
was he right that's like president barack obama has
had more death threats than any president in the history of the
united states you see because just that presence
of a black man in the white house like i think a lot of white people
who initially voted for him wanted to appear liberal yeah
you see but once he's in that white house and a black man with a black wife
and a black grandmother that's the whole package
they begin to understand oh my god
if he's in power and not only that the reception that he receives
all over the non-white world do you see so they started shaking
because people who classify themselves as white are not consciously carrying around in
their mind fear of white genetic annihilation they
repress that you see but how do we how do we know based on
other behaviors that they engage in and just like tom mexter said
the majority of white people are fearful of their genetic annihilation
sometimes white people will say to me dr welsing what can i do to help
and i say tell black people what white people talk about
when there's no black people around they all go silent
because what are they talking about they're either talking directly or
encode about white genetic survival i had a white college professor say to
me after i had i had been invited to speak at a prison
white university giving educational programs in a prison
100 of the prisoners black males so i went and talked about the same
thing i'm talking about here about racism so this white professor said to me
because she drove me out there drove me back home she said see sometimes when you push
truth and i'm not being rude and disrespectful people felt feel compelled to come out
with their truth so she said dr wilson you know i hate to admit it
but on all social occasions not some
not a few on all social occasions with white
people together and there's no black people around she said we are talking negatively about
black people and the assumption is that everybody present is in agreement
so i told her that i understood that see they're simply talking cold
they're just talking cold about their survival they are not going to reveal them just
say to us isn't it nice that we're in a democracy
you see but they are talking cold about their survival
and at the same time at the same time that a black man is in the white house
there are millions of people locked up in prison millions thousands of black men locked
up in prison you can say the incarceration of black genetic material
now i say that the system 24 7 is talking about
this critical problem
an activity that you would not think
is talking about quite genetic survival so one day one sunday it was so quiet i
said gee what's happening it was so quiet see when it's quiet you
can think yes and this is why they say now this is your music boom
see all that live music turns off the brain computer
because of sensory overload see they use loud music
our loud music to torture people in guantanamo
to torture people to make them go crazy
but they feed it to us and say this is your music this is what we want you
to hear but when it was quiet and i said what's going on
and it came to me ball games
and i said to myself work ball games to have a whole city be
quiet the ball games must have a significance
an important significance that we're not generally focusing on
so it's just proxy once you understand the context meaning system of white supremacy
for white genetic survival this is the context in which everything
language speech activity takes place
so it just occurred to me came into my computer there are two series of ball games
in the system of racism white supremacy if you read the isis papers don't answer
what are the two series of ball games see you're looking at it all the time
but if you don't see the context you won't see it but you're looking at
what are the two series of ball games if you read the book
you're going to be expelled
two series of ball in games system
of racism white supremacists our big brown
and no you read the book
brown is small white why so
because once we're talking about genetic survival
this is what automatically comes in the brain computer subconscious
and this is not a man with glasses
see why does this come into mind because
this this is a diagram of male genitalia
this is a phallus on the penis these are the testicles the testicles contain the genetic
material what are the testicles called colloquially
fall is that right see i don't make up stuff i just
observed balls so out of the same brain computer
that set up a system of white supremacy
comes to see this doesn't come out of our brain computer didn't have to
so the big ground balls mean the genetically dominant balls
and they are brown and what are they football
basketball basketball
small white marbles
tennis balls
but do you see what i'm saying now to me this is this is just fantastic
this is coming out of a system that is worried about white genetic survival and
by their thinking of the white ball as small
and producing small white balls means they at a subconscious level
are aware of their genetic vulnerability are you following me
seeing this is being played out these ball games are going on
all the time 24 7. so it doesn't matter whether you are picking it up
consciously or subconsciously it is still getting the message
across so beyond that
in the game of well first of all what do white females say about their
ideal mate
[Music] and so
in the football this big brown ball goes into some white upright legs
the basketball goes into a white net
are you all with me is this an adult class
and it's white girls and short dresses dancing on the side
and a black girl can hardly get on the squad is that correct
now a white man said to me dr wilson do you know what white men say i said no i don't
he said white men say they're not men until when
until they have had sexual intercourse with a black woman
see it's a lot of young people in here
see this is this is the underpinnings in the culture
this is what the culture is really thinking about it all the time
the people who were thinking so the most powerful men play what ball
games
now our president just got hurt playing basketball you see but what the game that the white
president's play now how is that game played
a long stick held between legs
trying to get the little white ball in a
[Music] in black mother earth [Music]
and if this is a written aren't any little children i see a couple
i'll dress the grown-ups
the golf course
is laid out and it always has waterholes
it has rough
it has sand traps and then it has a hole that is supposed
to go in now anybody studying anatomy and female
anatomy will understand this is pubic hair
see the ball happens to go in the rough before the ball can go in the water
see the female generator you have the vaginal opening you have the rifle
where the urine comes out then you have the anus and that's the sand trap
are you all with me yes i don't want any ruin anybody
we have got to understand racism
we have got
that while we're playing they're staying on the case
24 7 and that's how a minority
can control a majority on the planet
see by words by symbols
what about the game excuse me
what about the game of billers or pools
greenfield long stick triangle whole lot of colored balls
see the triangle is the female vaginal orifice
take the triangle off and what's the game about the white long stick white ball
knocks all the colored balls under the table and what ball is left on top of it
the white ball the black ball is the last ball
to go in we're doing too much parting and eating
and not observing the black ball is the last to
be knocked in and the expression is what
president obama you don't want to be caught where
behind you
see if you're behind the eight ball that means that the black maker is in power
what else can we look at already let's look at
the password that the black community use these at least it used to be
the people in new york brooklyn say [ __ ] yes
yes one day i came out of the clinic and it
was some young people passing and they were
so my first reaction is oh my god the second reaction
if a word or a phrase is used with high frequency
there has to be a reason behind it so i said to myself
in the system of racism white supremacy there are five people categories
man woman boy
girl baby
who is the man i said here comes the man you are
any other male has four choices
black men fought historically don't call me no boy is that
the right supremacists say okay you got three choices
woman girl or baby it used to be that woman and girl were
out baby was in
how many black ladies have called the black man that they are highly familiar with baby
[Applause] lying to yourself
how many gentlemen have called the lady that they're familiar with mama hey mama
can i ride with you let's get a witness
how many gentlemen have called the place where they sleep a crib
man who calls himself baby calls the woman he sleeps with mama
calls a place where he sleeps a crib [Music] we'll call himself what
a [ __ ]
are you all with me now my mother bless her soul
my mother was a chicago public school teacher so this is some time ago she's deceased
now but she caught up i'm in washington she's calling from chicago
hi mom hi my mother said hi francis
she said i heard that you said that word in public and i said mom what
you know i said no i don't my what what
she said marilyn farmer
i have never heard that before but you know i said my don't worry
it's a political expression how so
man who calls another man the man and calls himself baby
the power of a man compared to the power of a baby who's powerless
politics political means the power relationship between people
nobody has to feel bad this is the system that we're talking
about the system of racism white supremacy has
to take power from the black male if there is going to
be quite genetic survival
are you all with me
see now if we begin to understand this
so that we understand what we are dealing with
then we can begin to have choices about what we're going to do
on the black side of the chessboard because white supremacy is coming down
attacking us by any means necessary
see whether they have to do it with tuskegee syphilis experiment
hiv aids ebola whatever cholera in haiti whatever
for their survivors so if we don't understand the game
what in the world can we do you see but once black people once black
men understand the game basketball is a game about tactics and strategy
football is about tactics and strategy [Music] so all the person wants to know is
what's the game how's it played what are the rules but we have been deceived so we haven't
understood what the game is all about so we're floundering
all over the place not understanding and not making points
because we don't understand the system and i maintain
for those who want to do something about this critical situation
neely fuller has said there are four possible ways that a victim of a system can respond
they can submit they can cooperate
they can resist or they can engage in destruction of
now destruction of those are the people who are already dead
like martin luther king malcolm x the people who they're going to move
in spite of the pressure they don't mind losing their lives i'm
not advocating that these are all individual choices submission means it's too much
for me let it just roll on over cooperation with
just give me a job two figures three figures
resist i'm talking about the system so i'm resisting if they say francis will kill
you i'll probably jump back here
you see but at least to be consciously aware
of what is going on like neily fuller says who is an uncle
tom the person you see when you brush your teeth
that means see how quiet now that's just cooperating with the system
the slave master told uncle tom to take some other slaves to another plantation
he didn't run away he said i gave my word so i go back to the plantation the slave master did him in
but he was cooperating see if you stop at a red light you're
cooperating if you stop at the cashier in the supermarket
see you're old everything free every black person is due
several trillion dollars for what happened to us you see but so
you paid the cashier you stop at the red light we're into cooperation with but people
can decide to resist i say talking about what the system is really all about
not deceiving ourselves as to what the system is actually
about and the people who keep
resisting even though they're threats to their lives
they're in a special category this is not show-off category it's just where the person's will
and where their commitment is and again this is not about name calling white
people cursing out white people see i was given a lecture on thursday
i said you know one of the most important things we can do in relationship
to people who classify themselves as white is to say
we're afraid of you all we're afraid of you all
see how quiet it is that means that truth but it's not speaking out
do we have a right to be afraid
look at this
i said this is the problem
perceived as the problem when a white police officer so-called
stops a black man and says i thought he had a weapon he
does
it's genetic power you see think of all the cases i thought
he had a weapon the man just had his wallet in his hand
or his keys i thought he had a weapon and that's enough for the person to do
what see this is a front view of male genitalia this is a lateral view
if you turn that around 90 degrees you get this
what does that look like [Music]
and what is the gun called in the system
meaning you have weapon can annihilate me must create weapon can't do the same
thing do you see so where is the gun warm
one on each side that's just like this
and then it's called justifiable homicide
you see meaning any time i see a black male
and i get a little bit nervous if i'm authorized to carry a gun
i'm authorized to kill him are you all with me
i see fear
don't feel bad this is
war
war for white genetic survival by any means necessary
do you see but if we don't face what it is
then people are engaged in a pretense that everything is all right
but everything is not all right
we are in a state of a slide towards genocide
see you cannot have the men from a community removed
and have a people are you all with me
see but white supremacy is so bold on the front page of the washington post
a little while ago they said black women you should start because i know the black men are all
gone so you should start dating white men
on the front page of a newspaper
do you understand that's just like slavery
we're killing off the black men so hey you want to have a man so-called
you had a wife mate you seen that on the other side
they're saying now we are unleashing a certain number of white females
to go with black men because that will make them believe
that racism white supremacy doesn't exist a young man came up to me on thursday at
my institute and said i just came back from germany dr welsh
there's a lot of black men who are out of the service and they're
they're married to german women he said if it weren't for the color they
got you know they're kind of built like black women
see that's the caroline brigade so i said i guess you'll be going back
to germany see that the system has figured out
informal slavery when this white slave master would be rapidly raping
african women but the mother would be black
and she would tell the child you're black white females tell their offspring
you're not black you're mixed
now what does that mean she actually is thinking about black
to say to the child you are not black
but let him try to stop a cave let him try to get a job so he becomes
schizophrenic because he has been taught by the mother
to hate black i really don't respect your father
you see but these are all of the kinds of confusions and difficulties
that go along with maintaining the system of racism white supremacy
so every black person has a whole lot of choices to submit cooperation
or try to destroy so this is where we are so what do we do
seeing somebody because what we need we need some strong people over here
males are females of life so if i could wave a magic wand
if i could wave a magic wand
i would say for us to fight racism white supremacy
we need some strong people where do people start getting strong
twins
that's not the answer i'm looking for
they start getting strong before the sperm meets the
eggs know people used to insult people by saying you're a bird brain
you know because birds have little tiny brains
but i say the bird knows you build a nest
before you lay an egg
are you all with me yeah see nobody has to feel bad in other words we have been
victimized by a system
that does not want us to be strong and functional
the system can't tolerate black people being strong self-respecting and
functional and so it creates where we are
but if people are going to be strong i would say now don't chase me out
even soon see if i can wave a magic wand because
i'm trying to get an army over here
of self-respecting black people so i was saying
black people need to be 35 as males
30 as females before having sex
and they need to be married
because what the system has us doing see we're under fire 24 7.
this is stress city
at least for people to be old because if i'm 14 15.
there's no way i can pass on strength to a child it's no possible way
it's no possible way that i can take care of somebody for 25
years to stand them on their feet are you with me
in formal slavery we were breeders
and stubs
and the offspring
we're sent away to different plantations that's called foster care
are you all with me yes yes i'm so sick and tired of seeing patients
in foster care who were sexually abused
10 foster homes how can somebody come out saying
the intention for them to come out saying was not the goal
you are so hot see this is my fight back
i mean oh no you're not genocide guys
you see but they have see once you teach people call yourself a gangster
call yourself a thug call yourself a [ __ ] and a hoe
then it doesn't matter what happens to you what's supposed to happen to a [ __ ]
what's supposed to happen to a hope what's supposed to happen to a dog
the system says hey i'm really wiping you out if i can
and the only response is no you're not
no you're not for those who can't no
you're not but see we don't really have a convincing
response to that so they can how many people have seen cnn and so that o'brien
talking about jonestown and they keep putting it on
and putting it on and putting it on a thousand black people were killed
i say they had to be gassed following a white jesus
called jim jones i said they had to be gas because
dogs don't drink kool-aid and they had dogs dead
laying with their feet up in the air
you see and if you had drunk cyanide you would be convulsing but not laying
straight
but what they're doing is saying that we're going to kill a thousand of them
and see how they react let's see we'll kill 40
they don't react right let's see i killed two thousand in haiti
and telling us they have no reaction
are you all with me these are experimental
testing see what they do have resuscitated
and having them repeat gangster and thug
and [ __ ] and hope and [ __ ]
they're saying those are terms of endearment
either we have to give the sister the seniors
mission accomplished
mission tournament one you see so
we have to think how how can we start valuing
ourselves see when people are working see if you turn on your tv in the morning
you're getting fight fight white white fight fight fight blonde white women white black white
white fight fight fight quiet quiet quiet fight fight fight fight
quite quite white
see and then anderson cooper can come on cnn
and have the little children a little three-year-old white child
how many of you saw those programs yes it's too bad the audience didn't see it
because they gave little white children a strip with colored faces on it you
know like white face little tan face all the way to a black face
three-year-old white child which child is stupid without hesitation
the black child which child is ugly
which child is bad without a moment's hesitation
and then they did the same thing with some black children beautiful little children
which child is ugly black which child is dumb and stupid
black seeing both parents a white parent and
oh we don't know how
those are just primary lessons in the system of racism white supremacy
and all you have to do is put a child in front of the television and they learn the lesson
not to mention conversation that might go on in the household
about isn't that girl purdy now was she crystal black no
no see as the vibe fell my back is turned because i
see we have to get in touch with the truth
see little black babies the day they're born
the family goes to the hospital they're looking through the glass the nurse says this one is your uh uh no
that must be a mistake no that check the bracelet again
what does the system teach if you're black
[Music]
see i can do this in london
and if you're playing
see now this is just color-coded white genetic survival
because the more genetic power you have your skin is crystal black
a next lesser level of melanin production so-called brown slide red in there
and yellow white is not at all and so it stands to reason if the system
is about white genetic survival dark has to be out
so parents bring the little children to the psychiatrist dr welsing my daughter says
she's going to kill herself because the boys say she's too dark to date
are you all with me see we have to cure
if we're going to have any response going this way
we have to cure color sickness
just embrace yourself just say this is fascinating i tell my patients don't say
i'm stupid just say this is interesting this behavior that i have is fascinating
the behavior is just coming from what the system is granted 24 7 non-stop
for its genetic survival see teach them to hate themselves and
then all we have to do is bring some drugs in well first we
have to have unemployment see now it costs forty five thousand
fifty thousand dollars to maintain one black man in prison
for a year why couldn't he be paid
forty-five thousand dollars take care of himself a wife and two children
oh no we would rather have him locked up
learn how to be a lady
are you all with me the person doesn't have to feel bad no a
system is operating on us that we don't have a clue
about but we can begin to understand
where there is no vision of people will perish where there's no understanding the
people who perish so we have to make up our minds
that wait a minute we better understand this
because just like hitler said i don't care about their religion
talking about semi to the jewish religion read hitler minecon he said i don't care
about their religion i'm killing them because they're not white
see we got a whole lot of black people who miscegenated and could pass for white
that's what the semites of the jewish religion they came out of north africa
but if you move up into europe and you miscegenate we got a lot of black people
i think i'm gonna have a baby by a white man because it's gonna give my child a better chance
anybody hear that before we know all about that
so they had the same process going they thought they were in
you see but germany's economy websites does that sound familiar
and when everybody is shaking and nervous adolf hitler came on the scene
so what we're going to do is go we're going to kill him
i'm going to kill 11 million was the number he set for himself
he succeeded in killing 6 million see six minutes you ever start wondering
where the people who are moved out with gentrification where are they
where are they going out of sight
out of mind and if we are in a state of not caring
about ourselves we won't even raise the question
see we will not raise the question because what i don't care about myself
i don't like the way i look
it's okay if i'm dead so
what it's not about frightening it's about seeing i say this
that the creator of the universe made black people the first people
i'm not talking about a monkey the first human beings the first people
to know about family life the first people to know about god the first people to know about mathematics
philosophy architecture engineering
and the creator said i made you the parents of everybody on the planet
so i think that the creator in a certain sense is
okay i'm gonna test them i'm gonna have them taken through hell
and let me see whether they will rise up with what i
made them to be we are the parents of everybody including white people
all we have to do is have a mutation to albinism and that's why
it's a passage in the bible the sons of god saw the daughters of man
and they were fair meaning the sons of god
the crystal black people saw the daughters that were mutations
from man and they were fair
what does fear mean what
see this is like i gave a lecture in new hampshire a long time ago
and i told the white people i said you know maybe
we owe you all an apology we black people
say maybe we were the first child abusers
because we are the first people how many people are reading the articles that are coming out of africa about how
black people are treating the albino mutants mistreatment right
so here's the huge continent of africa here's the mediterranean
here are these little tiny countries of europe human life began right in this parish
these are crystal black people but for some reason some albino mutants were
produced and we chase them out
and i say that's the book of genesis adam and eve were in the garden of eden
they ate the forbidden fruit and became ashamed of their nakedness
see doctors even now try to you know some abnormality comes about one of the
first things we want to ask the mother what did you eat
did you eat the forbidden fruit
so the albino mutants were pushed out and directly north of africa is what
europe so they were pushed down up here
and thousands of years they collected collected collected formed a big group
and then what did they do they came back home
and got the mothers and fathers who rejected them
and took them west to america
and said now you're going to take care of the white people put that little black baby in a box out
in the field and you're going to nurse this white baby and he's going to take care of us
without charge and then
western culture history said that western civilization began where
come on class you don't want to read greece rome
and the founders of brown
and remus and what were they doing
so romulus and remus had to suckle on a wolf they meant that means they are foster children
are you all with me and then what do romulus and rhema start
a culture that says what
see the wolf is a canine the dog is a canine
and the culture says the dog is man's best friend
the dog is treated better than the black people
are you all with me see and if anybody has any experience with psychiatrists sees this all the
time let's say a child is given up by the parent
and so you know the fantasy is
that one day the mother and child will get back together
and they will embrace and live happily ever after
but that's not what happens there may be an initial embrace
and then what is the child's response going to be angry
you gave me up and so and so and so on
and anger and hurt and mistreatment
father so i say you know maybe this is the whole story
and so what do we do we apologize to the white people
and say but now since you set up this system of injustice
we're going to stop it so this is not going to continue
because this is not the way that we can have peace on this planet
and we are the parent people of the planet
and we are going to take our parental responsibility because i can see the creator
sitting up he she combination of both maybe
saying hey i made you all the first people on the planet
i gave you everything nobody is more than you
so don't call on me [Music]
i don't want to hear i want to see
whether you are in touch i hear that black people are the most
religious people are we in touch
see are we in touch you know even the white people say what
the most powerful thing in the universe is what a black hole
and now they discovered the thing that holds it all together is dark matter
now i say that if if we are hating black
see we need to review george washington carver
black man crystal black mate he said he would go out early in the
morning when it was quiet and the plants would talk to him
and tell them tell him what they could do see this pigment black is a superior
absorber of energy everything is energy everything is energy
what if these cells that we wish we could get rid of oh god give me some more bleach
what if the creator is saying i gave you they say
scientists say the melanocyte that produces this black pigment
is the second most sophisticated cell
in the human body second only to the best b-e-t-z
cells that are in the cerebral cortex that we think with
and we can't stand god please make me white
dr welsing please create a pill
that if i take on monday it'll turn what is mommy's favorite color
of a person what is daddy's favorite color a little child will tell us
what we think is beautiful and so you just use that not to shame
yourself you just use it as a corrective you say this is fascinating how i've
been programmed under racism white supremacy this is absolutely fascinating
so do you all follow what i'm saying yes
people who classify themselves as white are not going to deliver us
and the question is whether we
care enough about ourselves to deliver us
well let me stop and let you all ask some questions
[Applause]
whoever has questions i want to make it as ordinary as possible um if anything if you're close to this side
make a line here at the second row and over here and make a line from the second row whoever has questions
that they would like to document the answer and we're gonna do one side each
all right i'm starting on this side
[Music] real loud
[Music] all right everybody we gotta we gotta get some order here so she can get the
uh
so my question for dr wilson is do you what do you feel about do you believe
that black women are being used strategically as a tool like with the color girls not just the movie but also
the clay uh the color purple waiting to exhale a lot of black women in literature in
particular who are respected by black people do you believe that we're being used as a tool to
criminalize and to demonize and to destroy black men well say as long as we do not understand
the system we will be tools of the system whether we're male or whether we're feeling
if you see in other words black women don't have anything to do with white people making strategic decisions we
don't have to worry about the women do you see the in other words if we
control the men and destroy the men the women will also perish in the
process you see so it looks on the surface and then it's like if we don't
understand racism white supremacy where the sister will say give that woman a job
and pay her more than you pay him first of all that's going to create tension
in the household you see now a lot of times a man will say it doesn't matter to me
if she makes more money but his manhood in this system
is intact you see so dissension will begin to go forward
and he might even subconsciously she makes more i don't really feel like
a man how can i feel like a man i gotta have another woman two women three or four children
to give me proof that i am a man so then we end up with total chaos in terms of
what's happening to all of us you see so it's white supremacy that is
making the decisions and we are victims of it you see but they will use that
in other words whether it's precious type of fairy or any of the colored girls all of these images just go out
and look at these people see a reporter called me from
scandinavia and somebody gave her my name
and she said dr wilson do black people realize these images
and these movies are going all over the world and influencing how people think
about black people and see hitler understood i'm getting ready to kill the jews
so i'm going to use the magazines the newspapers and the movies
to make negative images of them build up that image in the mind of the people
the german people so when i'm killing them everybody will be thinking good riddance
of rubbish you see people looking at the images of us
do you see whether it's music videos all that trashy behavior
i'm suffering we have been reduced to trash and somebody from the outside looking at it
my god look at those people they don't deserve jobs they don't
deserve health care they don't need education
[Applause]
he's going to record the answer if you don't mind because this is for us don't worry about it all right all right
good um shy pacheco hamilton from facebook asks she said to ask you
what do you think about suicide rates rising among black youth
why not see it's like
if you see some of these male children that have what i call father hunger
they want their father so badly
i was just talking to a gentleman who's a social worker on thursday night
and he was talking about a child who's acting up in school
and he said that you know of course the parents are not married and the father
promises to come but he doesn't come and that hurts the child to his soul i
don't care what the mother is doing the mother is not a man
this is not in other words we are victimized as a people and to the extent
as nealy fuller said if you don't understand white supremacy racism
what it is and exactly how it works exactly how it works
it's attack on black people in general and black men in particular
for white genetic survival do you see so it's not about blaming
ourselves it's like trying to find the courage to look at white supremacy
finding the courage to say to white supremacy we're afraid of you
we're afraid to focus on you i mean that gets a whole lot of mileage
we are afraid i'm afraid i gave a lecture in london and the
people have been raising sand about me coming so i'm standing in front of this
audience and i said let me say this first of all i'm afraid of you all
i don't know what you might try to do to me oh no no oh don't worry guys
i'm saying but we should say no we're afraid of you what's the history
should the native american people be afraid yes
yes we're afraid lynching castration
beating justifiable homicide why wouldn't a sane person be afraid
so if we start saying that they'll start saying well what are you going to do we don't know we're too afraid right this
minute [Music] but we're trying to face reality
appreciate it okay
all right my question is my question is it's a little bit off the topic but it's based on poster
management and how black women
think of men black males lazy they don't want to work you know they're not the father they're
supposed to be they're not protected of a black woman they're not providing for the black woman they can't sustain a
family to call them out their names they want to be pimps is this because
generations of generations not being able to protect and provide because you couldn't because you had a weapon to
your head to watch your mother your daughter being slaved and raped repeatedly but you couldn't lash out
that you feel now that you feel more as a man by dominating another black man but you won't dominate a white man
because you could dominate a white man you couldn't look him in the eyes but they never gave you therapy to say
you're free but i'm gonna sit you down and tell you why you act the way you act because
you wasn't a man before you was a boy that was a european word for adolescent you never
evolve into a man that's three-fifth of you know so the reason why a lot of black men have a
problem they not understanding my question is how can you make the black woman understand why the black man at
the way yeah let me just say this again
the black woman is not the black man's problem thank you
[Applause]
do you understand what i'm saying i want the black men to understand this
well in other words we gotta like embrace ourselves
[Applause] and then
let's get down to understanding you remember some of the cowboy old cowboy
movies and it would be somebody like gary cooper or john wayne and he's telling
the woman she's don't go don't go i've got to go and fight the indians
you stay home i hope i get back yeah
but if i don't i'm taking care of business now i'm not see i'm not talking about
black men going out and finding a white man to kick now it's about
understanding what is being done by the white collective see black men need to
if i could wave another magic wand say no we're gonna work
see we we want jobs we want a
job see but you can train people if you have several generations
of mothers going to work and coming home and feeding male
children and that male child will grow up and ask a woman what kind of job do you have
see now this is this is just tactics and strategy on this side of the board
that we haven't been thinking about we haven't understood so then we quarrel
with each other and as long as there's fear
it's like the man on the job his boss kicks him he comes home and kicks the dog and picks his wife
who's his problem the boss on the job
do you see so this is where we have to get to
you see the woman is not going to teach the man how to be a man
you see what i'm saying and this is why i say that if black women would do their part our
part would be you really are fine
you really are good but 30 35
2 three see mary what if black women were saying
not out of hatred this is not a game bringing children in
the world thank you see this [Music]
no we're men we're going to work see we are going to work
but as long as the sex comes first
do you see like this what do they say why pay for the cow and you can get it
and so we don't have to feel bad these are patterns that we have fallen into
not understanding what the structure process goal of the system is
but it's like i can't say often enough black men stop focusing on the woman
[Music] see stop folk you're my if it weren't for you
i wouldn't have a problem it would be better if the black man said
look i can understand i can understand your frustration
because i'm not in a position to protect you defend you i can't protect myself
i can't take care of any children now if we were all saying that
was that this was not a war see nobody in afghanistan is jumping
out of a foxhole over behind a rock and talking i gotta get some right
see what i'm saying i mean we've gotta tighten up we've got to get into
discipline if we are serious about ourselves
see one of the secretaries of agriculture's name was butts
years ago said all black people want now he said this in public
it's tight [ __ ] loose shoes and a warm place to piss now he said it
in public why because they had bred us to be that
did you see not to stand on our feet because in other words i'm not going to
let you be a man if i can help it so black people have to say
no we're gonna be men now we and we're not gonna be wearing dresses and high-heeled shoes
and earrings
okay [Applause]
so i'm asking why is it we don't have a clue if it's so obvious
it's not in other words see imagine
children in the first grade black children white children in school
and the teacher says boys and girls good morning everyone
we are in a system of racism white supremacy
and this is how the system works the system is unfair to black and
non-white children and it treats white children as though they are superior
now then everybody starts understanding you see but what there is such a thing
as mis-education yes it is see it's just like going all over africa
and saying okay now here are your guns now i want you to fight these people
over here they're your enemy and they don't have a clue
so all over africa people are fighting and killing each other
you see just like here all over after i teach you to hate
yourself yes that's first i've got to teach you to hate yourself so when you look at your
image you're saying i hate there's another one that looks like me yeah i'll kill him
i'll kill her see so we've been miseducated for a purpose they're one-tenth of the
people on the planet the only way that a minority can overcome a majority is divide and
conserve and this is what they they are masters we could go around saying to the white
people you are the masters they'll say what imagine being at a cocktail party with white people
you're supposed to be acting like everybody's equal oh no master
no i'm not your master you've got two degrees no you are the master
you are running a masterful system we're just beginning to understand now
one thing you will not be invited to another culture
second part the second part is what role does um these planned
parenthood clinics in the middle of the black community and even the saint francis emergency room
and the fast food burger king what role does the duties play in the
system white supremacy well let me just start at this end
that they have chemicals perhaps you've heard about bisphenol
the chemicals that are in plastics and in baby bottles
that will turn a male into a female [Music]
now if you had this problem would you put it in a big mac if you
could yes
did you see what i'm saying or any anything else it's like we need to focus on the fact
we've got an epidemic of a feminization of black man
even the pediatricians are noticing it but afraid to talk about it
see we ought to be saying wait a minute wha what is going on here
that's just like hiv aids see they could be doing saturation in
the 80s i was in london and if you turned on the television you
would see commercial after commercial get tested get tested get tested get
tested they don't have any mass movement to test people here
they can test everybody in the prison testing when they come out
no why should i why would i make a biological weapon
if i don't want it deployed and if i deploy it i'm not going to pull it back i've got a purpose
you see so black people ought to be saying hiv is biological warfare until
proven otherwise
if you're going to have sex decide you're going to have self-respecting
safe sex do you see or have you been tested yes yes
see but it's like if my brain has been reduced to i'm a dog and i'm a hoe
and i'm a [ __ ] why should i be tested it doesn't feel
the same or why should i use a condom meaning i don't care if i die
i don't deserve to live see like they were saying in nazi
germany about the semites of the jewish religion life unworthy of life
life unworthy of life we have been conditioned to feel that about ourselves
and to step into i don't care which
is programming in the system so i hope that answers
[Applause]
reading is more repeat after me reading reading is more important
i get on trains every day to do my poetry my question is this how can i
we wake people up with your messages when most of our people throw up 20 foot walls close their ears in their minds
and i see this every single day when i get on the trains and everything and i'll get in the train of cards and everything and like there's always like
a small a certain amount of percentage that always gives me and i'm gonna like they'll you know acknowledge and
everything like that you know but um how do we make people want to ingest the truth you know any suggestions if you
have any advice yes see how do we relate to one another yeah
and like the church says whosoever will let him come not whoever i can bang over the haters
right you see so somebody says look i don't want to hear anything about racism
that crazy dr wilson i don't want to hear it you see that say that's okay
that's okay do you see it if you don't get anybody to listen you write your
poetry right do you see what is you know people say to me dr
welsing i heard you 20 years ago and i knew you were crazy
it was 20 years later then they'll say now i understand
you see what i'm saying so no we have to embrace ourselves and we have to embrace
one another and let me just say the stops nearly fuller these are stops
stop name calling one another thank you stop stop gossiping about one another
stop squabbling with one another yes stop cursing one another
stop snitching on one another yes stop being discourteous and
disrespectful to one another stop robbing one another
stop stealing from one another stop fighting one another and stop
killing one another yes now i've added some to it stop using and selling drugs to one
another see because the thing that they're bringing out now is medical marijuana
now that's going to say to every young black person oh this is medicine
but we won't have a clue as to what's in it and they had a two-hour long program on
tv they got a black couple who are one of the chief manufacturers
see that's to suck us in yeah so please be careful so stop using and
selling drugs to one another stop making black children think that as children
they can be adequate mothers and fathers stop pretending that racism white
supremacy does not exist stop throwing down trash where black
people live work and play yes if you're willing to live around trash that's right you're thinking of yourself as
trash every black person needs to get a phd in broome stud
[Applause] stop allowing racism white supremacy divided black brown red
and yellow people okay [Applause]
my name all is i'm a um college student i'm a
double major africana studies in anthropology and i just wanted to
say that when i'm in classes it's the disrespect level from the
teachers like they want i sit in the front you know where i dress up you know i raise my hand the
non-acknowledgement and even this could relate to a job what do you suggest that we do in order to deal with that
because sometimes it makes you feel like it made me feel reminiscent of religion just the emasculation
that happened well you know it's like if you read our history
there are black people who have integrated schools and they made black people sit behind
the screen yes you see you were not allowed to be in the same space
with whites see now if you have in your mind they're supposed to like me
they're supposed to accept me as opposed to i understand racism white
supremacy you see and the teacher is doing his or her best
to discourage me to make me give up like they did study some time ago
where they found out you know a little black child let's say he's seven years old and he's got the answer and he's
raising his hand like that and the teacher just keeps ignoring
and then come down and he is despondent
because he thinks now imagine you see if you go into class and say
well this is interesting this teacher is acting like they think of me as the enemy
well i understand fear of white genetic annihilation
so i'm just going to sit here do my best to pass the exams
and come out and help black people [Applause]
[Music] the more i become myself
the more i'm conscious of white supremacy it's like i feel like the world is
against me now because i'm trying to awaken my people around me what did you do
when he was going through it because i was seeing you at around my knees and now i'm i feel like i'm an issue
at that time but now you're in 2010 where the consciousness of black youth is not the same
so it's now it's like it looks like i'm the crazy one to think in a certain way and trying to change the youth
and i have like teachers like god said making me feel like i'm wrong
for speaking from my own experiences in life what did you do to humble yourself from being angry or rational because
like i get into battles with these teachers or people and i'll tell myself that's not the way
but i feel like and i'm very respected to like i speak to them the way i should but i
still feel like at the end of the day i'm the one that's cast out and put to the side like i don't know
what i'm having to do well see in other words we are in a war
and if you don't understand you're in a war you why are these bullets coming at me
you see no you gotta really understand i would say to patients sometimes because
they would be complaining about discrimination on a job and i say you've got to have in your
mind that the clothes that you're wearing might as well be battle fatigue
you see you're going into the war zone and you are being you know if you're not
being promoted if you don't have the right salary and all that stuff that goes on like the young man was talking
about this is what happens in the system of racism white supremacy
it's not a system of justice you see so you may have to pick your battles but the most important thing
you have to decide i value myself that's right you see and
i say self-respect is sort of like the armor of god yes it
is did you see that you have to value yourself and that's why when they were
running all that negative imagery at us it's weakening our armor of self-respect
you see so you have to just understand the process of the war and decide that you are going to be
self-respecting and patient i gave a lecture at a hospital one time
and i'm talking about racism white supremacy so a white doctor got up and he said
uh you're paranoid and i just smiled and so then a black
person got up and said he said you're paranoid and you just smile i said no he
gave me a compliment he said i understand racism white supremacists
they said i'm saying the system doesn't acknowledge itself right it's not going to validate
you see if they acknowledge that their whole system was fear white genetic annihilation
their thing will be washed up tomorrow yes do you see so they're not going to
acknowledge and see the more they ignore you and the more you practice
being calm and self-assured like during the vietnam war i used to look at the woman on tv who
was not the north vietnamese negotiator madam ben
and she was so calm and i used to wonder you know her people
are being really ward physical war against and she's just calm and i used to say i
want to be just like madame [ __ ] you see where you know what the war is
and you can stand up and talk about it without yelling and screaming now is it
difficult
you see but it's like you have to everybody has to find out what is my purpose
what am i supposed to be doing on this planet
all right what am i supposed to be doing as the mothers and fathers of everybody
on this planet
[Applause]
good evening the question is this if um the story of remorse and wrongless is true and they
are children um is it also true that they have less active strains of dna
than we do to what i understand they have only six and we have nine well see let's not just focus on
what they don't have right because whatever they don't have they're standing on us
this is it i'm saying and so what you want to look at is what are they doing
what are they doing to us now what is our counter strategy right
you see because of the things just like saying you are genetically inferior in terms of intelligence
you see or you're a minority when they're the minority right you see so
all that stuff what we have to understand is what is it that they're doing and why are they doing it
they're doing it to genetically survive but if we say you know it's like
i'll say white people are smarter than we are now that usually doesn't go down well
with black people you see but what are you saying i mean that's like whatever football
team is your favorite team and if they lost do you see what i'm saying you say they
lost they lost see the fact that somebody is smart
people who are standing on you are smarter than you are right at that moment in time because you haven't
figured out how to get them off exactly so if we just went around saying you white people are really smart
you don't have to say smart ems you say you are smart
you are you all are smart you all are seen follow you are a tiny minority on the planet
and you're controlling the whole planet now you make them want to go home
did you see what say you're smart we haven't figured out how to checkmate
you yet yes but we're thinking about it
as a matter of fact we are putting partying on the side like a young man who's in law school
in florida called me up and he said dr wilson
the black students are failing their courses
but they're doing the step in law school staffing
see it's like we have been led into foolishness
and he said the asian students are looking at him
what in the world are they doing why aren't they in the library yes
see so it's a whole lot of things we got to examine that were okay
when we were not thinking about victimization see we can give up singing and dancing
we got phds in that we got phds and foolishness
do you see what i'm saying that what we don't have phds in is getting people off of our backs right
you see we don't have phds and behavior that reflects
that we respect ourselves and that's what we got to go after
okay
[Applause]
[Music]
i um a sister of mine told me that you were in town and you
you should your ear should be ringing because i mentioned your name all the time i have followed you since the days
of first woman and from then until now um
everything that you have said has come to pass um it's unfortunate but it has
um i heard a tape of yours a while back and i remember you stating
that what is going on with us could have started even biblically
and i am in theology school right now and it has and even before that
um right now i live in brooklyn i'll just say this to everybody and i live in flatbush and it seems as though to me
it's like a genie has just come out of a bottle and all the negativity that we
have learned for whatever thousands of years is just you know just coming forth and i guess
my question to you in one way is why that's the first question the second thing is that
um like you said before we get into the intellect i mean it's
nice to be educated but we keep looking and comparing about
we're smarter and they're smarter and at this point it's neither here nor there to me to me
it's like you said it's a question of self-respect and finding out why we're on this planet
and on doing the creators work um something else i was gonna say to you and i can't remember but i'm so thankful
that you're here i'm so thankful that you that have continued to say the same
thing i told my friend one of the things that i have found with you all the time that you have been always able to get your
message of course without using curse words and i personally have a problem with
that because i say that if in the beginning was the word and the word was
and the word was good then i think that when we're communicating with each other in terms
of lectures that there is no need to go into that
white supremacy mode i mean i think you've been around long enough and we've discussed in terms of the language the
ms and all the other words that go along with it that we should try to alleviate that i mean i don't use the
word but my favorite word at home is aws and every time i use it there's a jar that i have to put adoption
okay so um again i um thank you so much and one last thing you mentioned somebody
mentioned about reading i read a book on dickens it was on crime and education i
was reading it online and i'm just curious to know it's like a script when you read it about the educational system
that went on in england during his time it's like a script that is being done right here within the board of it and my
question is why um is that and i just want to hope for that
[Applause] possibly about the education system in
different times do you see where they had classes and they were you know economic classes
and interested in holding certain people locked in their lower class so
they don't get an education to see why should you educate people that you want to hold down
down or hold into a pressure you see the people have to like black people did in formal enslavement where
you could be killed if you tried to learn how to read
did you see but people learned how to read on a dirt floor or they snuck and tried to find ways to
learn how to read did you see but now we have the programming has become more
what should we say intensified and sophisticated so we have young people saying if you're trying to learn you're
acting white you see which means that black people we are stupid
and we are supposed to be stupid and the white people are supposed to be white i'm supposed to be quite supposed to be
smart you see so again it's understanding if you understand the system that's like if
a doctor understands the disease then the symptoms are placed within the
framework of understanding the disease the doctor who's just running after the symptoms
is doing poor medicine but thank you very much
[Applause] [Music]
i thank you for being you and all the work that you have done over the years and
your contribution it is really important
most important i will say because many of us
are stumbling blind under the western domination
without realizing it and searching for answers and continue to search for answers and continue to
have questions no one other than yourself
with the exception of a maybe i can compliment one hand that has given us
explanation to whiteness and why that and why am i overqualified to get a job or why i'm not just getting a job i just
didn't understand and you yourself i've been funny for at least 10 years you yourself and others
have made that abundantly clear and i want to thank you for that and i would also like to say that
one of the reasons for um white survival not white supremacist
although it's part you know although they complement each other is the fact that um
scientifically the caucasian race cannot reproduce the offspring to the rate of a
black queen so this is another angle and another reason for the white supremacy
um yeah mike um one one of the questions is a short statement then a question
i would like to say that we as the people don't owe them an apology for
nothing why because going back
when they were in africa as albino genetic mutants before they were cast out they were cast
up because they misbehaved so this is the reason why they were cast
out in the first place because we had no system or society for jails and things like that
so i just i just wanted to say that and there's so much more but time is of the
essence and i thank you we must thank touch
you know in our society there are children born who are deformed
and have various severe abnormalities and right here we push push them away we
put them in institutions do you see so just like in africa today
do you see the albino mutants might not be doing anything but we're saying something is wrong with you
and you don't look right see it's nothing wrong with apologizing
right you see somebody might be able to come up with a cure for albinism
any black person in this room could have an albino mutant offspring all right did you see so it's like you
instead of being afraid like the people in some of the african countries
think that the albinos have power now of course being under white
supremacy they do have do you see them saying they have power you got white people running over to
rescue them and everything and so white represents power in a system of white supremacy so
it's nothing i tell parents you know
sometimes parents do things to hurt children yes and adult might come to the
psychiatrist's office and i say you know they're talking about the abuse and the kinds of things that the parents said
and i said will your parent come in will your parents come in not so the
doctor can throw a vase at them but to say
this hurts your child could you apologize as the parent
do you see can you say i am your parent i brought you in the
world you didn't have a say about it and so if i have hurt you in any way
i'm going to apologize to you or i'm going to sit silently and listen
to you tell me how i hurt you
because i'm your parent i brought you in this world and my shoulders are broad enough
to hear your criticism you see and that helps the person begin
to heal because it's wounding this i mean that's just you know
humility and ain't nothing wrong with being able to say
i'm sorry i made a mistake you see we could say we knew you were going to raise all this happening
you see but that the first time i did it i thought that the white people were just going to go into because i said
obviously you think we are your kin which is why you have aunt jemima
feeding you uncle ben's feeding you
do you see you got oprah
[Laughter]
she's the wealthiest lady in the entertainment world yes she is she telling to come and tell tell us
tell me blessings
doctor thank you for being here uh you have you have nine um
yes and i heard recently that you added attempt health no it is
well uh maybe i'm misunderstood but could you just explain how health i mean it's
obvious because you explain your voice how health plays a big part see how you can put the nine areas of activity
economics education entertainment labor law politics religion sex at war
and so when stuff is going wrong in any of those areas of activity
that impacts the well-being of the person you see the stress in economics the
stress in education the stress with unjust laws all of that is impacting health so
health doesn't have to be a separate area of activity
okay that's my opinion yes first and foremost i would like to
um i'm very nervous i am so honored
to be in your presence because this is my first time
hearing about you i just recently learned about your works and i listen to your video tapes and
everything and i'm beginning to understand the situation but i also want to let the audience know
that i brought my son here who was 21 years old
and i told him if you can watch all of that foolishness on a television that you have to make time to come and
see
[Applause]
[Music] you know somebody might say well how are
you able to do what you do and you know what
is in my mind i say because i had the parents that i had
see because i had the grandparents that i had my paternal grandfather was a physician
in chicago he died in 1909 and my father uh who's now deceased but
at some point much later he gave me some written material that
his father had written about and my grandfather had written
how dare anyone think that they're superior because of the color of their
skin thank you do you see now i never knew him and i ended up writing
about racism and color when i wrote the crest theory i was sitting down talking to my father
sitting at the dining room table and my father said okay i read the crush theory
now you have to find out what's in the melon and i never would have thought that
you see without my father guiding me in that direction
so it's like i am extremely grateful that i had the parents that i had
parents who were political do you see parents who would drive you know dragged us to hear paul rosen who
would drag us to hear w.e.b du bois do you see we might be sound
see my parents didn't say did you want to go
no you are going to go and hear this
you see you are going to take these courses in school because you need that
in order to do thus and so so i'm just extremely grateful
for the parents i mean you know you don't have anything to do with selecting them
but i'm glad that i had the parents who were political people politically thinking
people left-wing thinking people like
richard wright wrote some of black boys in my godmother's house in chicago
do you see so these are people who because of the way they were thinking they guided us
to you know feel that we have a right one time the
fbi cia was investigating me
because i wrote a letter to the president and they killed the children in birmingham
and so my mother called up and said you know the government people have been
here questioning us and i said you know questioning my parents
about my activity and so i asked my mother
what did she say and my mother said she said i told them that we raised you to
protest so what more can you add
on that note you kind of like answered the question i was going to ask
because myself as a parent of a six-year-old daughter um i didn't have that from my parents with
the politics i only have parents of haitian descent so it's within their blood which transferred to me
to open myself to the information to pass on to my daughter my mother
she's more religious so i was always i would always be there because i never
she never asked me do i want to go did i want to go to church i just had to go to church and i would sit there and it
would always be so confusing to me so as i got older and i started reading and meeting different people who were giving
me the information and reading your book my child now was in a school that was
that was run by our people but they still held on to the traditions of the white
supremacy and things that i tell her that are not productive for her
and her melanin dominance and her role in this phase of everything
so my question was she is now in a different school where it's still a situation where she's still
trying to find herself i feel like everything that i'm giving to her she's looking at it as
you're always talking about that stuff but this is what everyone else is doing but we are i tell her all the time you
are in this world but you don't have to be of it you know but you have to kind of like find your way i know you're six years
old but i'm gonna keep giving this information to you because one day it will make sense
it will make sense because i know right now with your peers my current in our current environment is
going to uh um feed for the children to still look a different in a different direction they're going to want yes that
straight hair because she tells me i want my hair like this and i wanted to do this and drop like this no it's not
going to happen like that honey um you have curly hair and it's just not going to happen oh well um
and i did it the other day i took her into a um into one of these stores and i said well which doll grandma wants to
get you a doll and she told me to bring you here so you can pick the doll there were three different shades i said which
doll would you like and she didn't pick the um caucasian looking doll but she picked the kind of
spanish looking one now the darkest one was in the middle i said well why didn't you pick that one
oh okay i'll pick that one no you you chose that one for a reason because in the school that you attend these are the
children that you see around you those are the children that get the attention those are the children that the boys kind of lean um towards you know to uh
oh i like her because she has this kind of hair or this is her complexion so i wanted to know besides homeschooling
what is the best way to kind of like teach your child in
this um environment that we're currently in like what's kind of schooling like what
besides homeschooling in other words i wouldn't know i wouldn't know a department of psychiatry
to tell somebody to train in that is talking about racism white supremacy
they don't exist do you see so it's like a lot of
education gentle education you see not being upset
with your daughter when she says i want the white one or i want the one that looks spanish
see i would say just as a suggestion for next time that you said okay mama buy you the one
that you select but i'm also going to buy you the one that mom thinks is most beautiful
do you see so i want you to have this because mother thinks this is absolutely
beautiful but not being shocked or surprised
because the children have taken in what the culture is teaching
you see i tell children who might be engaged in sexual activity
they see two things if not more but one thing i mean all you can do is look at
movies and listen to music and look at you know this is sex xxxxxxxxxxx sexy
and i say because white people are unhappy if they're unhappy with their appearance
you will be unhappy about the act that produced you that goes also
for us you see all the negative things that people can have to say about the
act that we should have the highest level of respect for
you see but not be surprised when the children internalize the culture we're
not surprised if everybody in the house speaks english we don't say how did the child learn how
to speak english because that's what's being spoken
in the house you see but there's a lot of education that has to go on in the
home and i will repeat you see the education of the child
begins before the sperm meets the egg that's
right you see because that's engaging in whether there's going to be respect
for the thing that is the product of that activity do you see it if i'm playing with sex
the joke is on the offspring okay
[Applause]
and i was introduced to the isis papers in 2006. and this is what my first thing was oh
my god how do i understand why why people hate it so much because i couldn't figure it out okay so
you gave me an answer that it was something but at least my hands are kind of answered so thank you for
thanking neely also my second thing was this woman has courage
to write this you know to stand up and speak and share this information so i have a couple of
products what i also want to thank you for having your courage it will affect these brothers for holding the space and
creating this space one thing that you said that i wanted you to
comment on you said white people have they're smart and i've always said
they're brilliant but on the other hand the other night i was on the train to do a spiritual
service and i said to myself if i had the courage i would write a book and call it the
predator race because that race of people
is willing to destroy everything and through the planet everybody i mean i don't think that there's any group of
people that i've read about who was more willing to kill everybody
and everything in sight and i think that's part of the problem that we're facing i do think that we are
now killing each other but not at the level of like the arabs now are beginning to understand what we've been
dealing with and so are the you know the people that are doing you know so
so okay that's the question that what do we do you talk about the fear when you're dealing with the race of
people who would want to destroy everything including the planet and the other thing is i was surprised to find out that whites
wanted to have you lecture to them uh speak to them what is that all about
no it's like the places where i have encountered white people is when i've been invited by black people wow see it
might be a black student union or something like that
cause you talk about the fear which is something
you see oh that person those people they can they can hurt me they can hurt me
make me disappear you're saying so yes they're going to
buy anything that they can cook up with their brain computers it's just like people who feel
inadequate will manifest that in greed
you see i feel deficient so i have to have all the oil all the gold all the minerals all the like all the people all
that because i'm feeling it okay so i have to look at this inaudible
see in other words we have fear because we have been brutalized by racism white supremacy
you see but self-respect helps you get over
and get over fear so at some point my self-respect
outweighs my fear like sometimes people say how do you get the courage to do
that i'm more afraid if i understand something and understand the plight that we are in
as a people i'm more afraid to not share it
that i am afraid of what can happen to me
[Applause]
yes i wanted to first start off with the common uh compliment rather of self-respect that i learned from you and
then that's going to kind of segue into my question i first read the isis papers keys to the
colors back in 1996 and i think prior to reading that book i was functionally illiterate i had never
picked up a book or read anything i managed to graduate high school but in hindsight i'm not sure how
but when i read your book not only did it give me self-respect but it was it really encouraged me to want to grow as
a person to want to learn in order to be able to effectively make changes since that time
i'm at nyu now working on my second master's degree
my question is at nyu at that uh at uh the lower part of manhattan i mean
there's a real disconnect between african americans i mean you can barely get a higher bot
from blacks on the campus where do you think we are in terms of self-hate and what can we do as
individuals to kind of offset that self-hate that we have amongst each other
you know when i was in college at antioch and uh yellow springs ohio and i graduated in 57
and integration that like i was the only black girl in my class so integration at that point was one black girl one black
guy so there might have been six or eight black students on the campus
and nobody would speak dc because everybody was afraid if i'm
friendly with another black person the white people don't like
because they can deal with one at a time but we have i mean you know
no we've been damaged every time you turn on the tv every time you go to the movies every time you go to a play every
time you listen to music most of it is damaging to us it's not telling us
we need to embrace another we need to love ourselves and
embrace one another so if you understand i'm not taking personally the fact that
they won't speak i'll just keep trying but i won't make a nuisance of myself
but i'm open to see i'm not i understand i understand
why i might have the weaknesses that i have and i understand the weaknesses that they
and keep pursuing those degrees [Applause]
sisters about um because i feel that education is one of the most powerful
ways i feel that education is one of the most powerful ways
that we brainwash our people because you know our children are brainwashed
from such an early age um so my question is i work in a school middle school i'm
a counselor at a middle school the population is 199 percent of black children teachers
are on the majority like i find myself feeling like i'm perpetuating the same system that um
that i'm perpetuating the same system that i'm telling the children to
to question so my question is how do i i feel like if i'm not there in this school they
won't have anybody to teach them the truth music blackfield
yes i've tried educating teachers i've done a workshop
to help the teachers understand the black experience
and so my question is how do i i guess how do i
work within the system well you may in other words a system
is not necessarily going to be open to you teaching black children to have
respect for themselves you see but if you have any leeways
like it just came to my mind as you were talking langston hughes
i believe it was langston hughes corn little brown baby not paul on denver a little brown baby with sparkling eyes
come to your daddy and sit on his knees you see so you are looking for i'm gonna
be looking for things that i can read to these children i'm going to be looking for pictures that i can put on
the bulletin board that are positive images of children
i used to be clinical director of a school in a mental health clinic called paul
robeson center for growth and development now why paul rosen because he excelled in
sports he was a you know intellect he was
so you can you know you can make bulletin boards and show children
and i believe in asking children everybody every child in school the teacher ought to say sweetheart what do
you want to do when you're all grown you see what do you want to become
and emphasizing you can be anything that you want to be if you're willing to work
hard now that's you know you're not maybe not going to be able to tell them
about racism white supremacy but you can say you're beautiful you're black and you're beautiful
you see i love the way you look you see as opposed to yanking on
somebody i mean you can get on the bus or maybe the train and see what races
and white supremacy has done you know get over here
you see yanking and screaming there and pulling on children and calling them out
of their names as opposed to sweetheart let me embrace you let me help you learn
the understanding i'm saying or learn how to speak to them in a calm
caring voice so the child really begins to sense this person cares about me
[Applause]
i think you kind of answered the question a bit but i still want to ask him educating our children at this point you
know about racist white supremacy and all and all of these things is almost a violent act now it's perceived as a
violent act and institutions such as acs child welfare
they'll remove your child from the home if they if they're found saying these things how do i know this recently there
was an incident in my daughter's school i was talking to a parent who was educating her i think it was her
seven-year-old son about what this was and what was happening and i guess report time came he's in school he wants
to do the report about malcolm x and stokely carmichael the teacher adamantly refuses he needs to choose george
washington or lincoln the boy refuses to do the situation starts talking about my mommy said this is racist and this is
the other sends the child to the guidance counselor next thing you know swarm of acs caseworkers are involved
you know in intruding upon the person's home finding out if there's evidence of neglect or what or you're
spreading racist propaganda with the child this is mental abuse exactly
so now even educating your children about what they're going to be encountering
okay it's not it's a violent act that will have your children taken from you well you see again like their ways of
thinking through and doing things you see you don't set a child up to go
to school and be disrespectful to the teachers do you see like sometimes a student you
know could be high school i mean a college or a graduate school student who said dr welsing i want to use your
material in my thesis and i said check with your instructor
see in other words you are there to get credentials so that you can come out and do
something the system is you know it's like i was told i couldn't have promotion in tenure
at howard university college of medicine you see because of that paper you wrote okay redeem the christ he didn't even
know the name of it you see i subsequently heard
oh the federal government made them do that where's the money coming from
do you see so no you just say oh this is interesting now um mom teaches this at home
if you find a teacher you could as a parent you can go up to the school and ask politely can my child write
about student in carmichael do you see would they get a passing or you know
a a-class well no we don't really want [Music]
you want george washington fine we write about george washington and we can write
about stokely carmichael and malcolm x at home
thank you [Applause]
a lot a large population we all know is in jail a large population of the men that we
need i'm saying to fight this war so i think we should be like
going more into into getting that info man because the brothers in there right when they in there at this point you
know they're not you know you're more conscious i think we should be pushing harder
now so when they come home hope for the kids
you know the activists and people like yourself and people like me
well first of all i'll share with you something that neely fuller says
do everything that you can possibly do
to stay out of greater confinement
you see in other words that's not set up to be anything that is positive
so that if somebody fails to master that lesson
see in other words it's like it's like sometimes people think oh i'm going against the system using and
selling drugs you're not going against the system the system puts that there for you
[Music]
the system puts that there they got a step by step
take his father out of the home right cause him to be depressed
cause him to use crack cocaine heroin to deal with the depression he doesn't know
he's depressed and street treating depression okay then he will break the law and then
i will have him in the concentration camp prison they got it all set up
so nobody you're not outsmarting him you're outsmarting him when you say i
gotta do everything just stay out of that i got to do everything i can to get
a maximum education you see but if i happen to get in there
give me some books a lot of places they won't let you have books
you see but what you can do is have some code well this is an opportunity for me
to practice no cursing no name calling
you see those are exercises in black mental health and black self-respect
instead of the exact opposite see even if people just said
instead of all that you know they see those tv programs lock up
do you see and all the yelling and streaming that goes on people just practice you know we're gonna be real
quiet again we're going to be real quiet it's not going to be any yelling and
screaming there's not going to be any name calling
it's not going to be any discourtesy and disrespect people can get in small
groups and say you know we gotta practice mental health in spite of the fact that they want to
harm our mental health but if we engage in certain behavioral
practices we will be improving our mental health
in spite of what they're hoping is going to happen you see we have to do everything we
possibly can to maintain gender identity
you see we have to struggle
to not have our gender transformed
see which is a struggle for manhood you see it's all a part of strategic
encountering you're seeing if michael jordan can fly
don't tell me we can't do what we make up our minds
