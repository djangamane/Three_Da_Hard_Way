peace be unto you my brothers and sisters may the peace and blessings of
Almighty Creator revealed to all and known by many names and of our positive
African ancestors rest and abide with each and every one of you may they protective hand be with you
their prosperity and wisdom I am indeed thankful this evening to be able to
gather with you in the discussion of this subject and I'm thinking about the
fact that there was a time when more than two Africans would gather together
here in this hostile environment to discuss anything that were viewed with
suspicion but if they were found discussing the topics that you discuss in this place their lives was set on the
line tonight we're able to gather here in this setting that is truly a setting
of our own creation and have our little bit of Africa tonight own oasis in the
midst of the storm and so it is a wonderful experience to be able to share
that with you here this evening how you feel good you're looking good looking
real good I want to give special thanks to the organization that brought us in
as it's the after a um you am I'm sorry
okay thank you you AM United African movement isn't yes
thank you and the brother Bundy who was
so kind to and looked after me so well once I got here in the city and thanked
I'm so thankful for his kindness and care and keeping dr. Felder who I
understand is one of my best press agents here one of fourth dynasty is best but we didn't even know that you
were with the organization we are together I
understand he is the foremost press agent for 4th dynasty publishing company here brother Roy Canton and attorney
Maddox brother mark rally for his stimulating interview on the program
today I want to thank them now before I get into the topic for this evening I
just have to do a black nationalist commercial for a moment to mention to
you you know that we are with 4th dynasty publishing company which is owned and operated by the Barra Shango
family and which is committed to disseminating the accurate information
relative to African people and to this evening unfortunately I was only able to
bring a few copies of African people in European holidays Ameno genocide book 1 & 2 but I do have
a goodly bit of copies of God the Bible and the black man's destiny which covers
some 800 historical biblical and scientific facts on the African origin
of the Bible the African origin of Christianity and and many other subjects along that line as well as the very
beautiful African woman original guardian angel which documents some of
the wonderful and major contributions made by the black woman her creation of
an ongoing contribution to world civilization so they are available there at the table our topic this evening in
our discussion is holidays from the perspective of African Senate historical
reality so often we are compelled by the
conditions in the environment we live in to look at things in a fantasy manner a
fan stick way rather than from the viewpoint of reality the object of the whole
african senate movement in bringing forth active written information not
only in terms of history but every other field of discipline is to be certain
that we as a people are able to be confronted with and be made to deal with
and to have the tools the powerful weapons of reality whether that reality
is pleasant or unpleasant we must be able to deal with reality in order to be
rational and sane and to reach that place for which we are being called to
go and that's why we entitled this topic tonight holidays from the perspective of
african senate historical reality why historical reality and reminded the
words of el-hajj Malik el-shabazz peace be upon him affectionately known to us
his brother Malcolm when he said of all our studies history its best qualified
to reward all research and so it is when you get into the history of something
then you have a better understanding of what it is what it was created for what are its purposes and objectives so
that's why we're approaching it from the perspective of an african senate historical reality african senate
because their ears has been and we are
still being subjected to a Eurocentric worldview and it's still a great and
wondrous struggle going on to break the bonds of that worldview and so now we
must do things from what we are and we are in african people i know i don't
have to explain that for anybody in and that's how you see things it's how
you look at things from your experience we have several premises I would like to
discuss with you before we get into the historical elements of the topic tonight the first premise is holidays are the
institutionalized celebrations of the thoughts and ideas of a particular
philosophical worldview what does that mean in essence not that you really need
an explanation of it but I always have to explain sometimes even what I say to myself the institutionalization of our
old thoughts and ideas and our own creations part of the process of doing
that in helping to keep those thoughts and ideas alive and nurturing us and
motivating us in our everyday existence and our everyday struggle and fight for
total mental physical and spiritual liberation from this beast here from
this hostile environment as a part of that process celebrations play a very
definite role holidays are important to us
but in those holidays if they do not reflect our life experience if they do
not reflect the positive aspects of our worldview of how we see the world of how
we understand the things around us then we have to ask the question what good are those holidays to us but should we
be celebrating them or should we be celebrating something else literally stop here for a minute to discuss
something that dr. shake on the Diop set forth and that is the idea it has always
been known to us who have been aware in thinking people and in the process of an
continued evolutionary path of enlightenment that there was a quantitative and qualitative
difference between the way that we as a people look at the world and the way
Europeans look at the world brother Malcolm stated it so beautifully and
straightforward say when you sit down to the table with the white man to discuss
an issue to discuss an idea you're not speaking the same language it was
difficult for some of the Negro leaders of that day to understand what he was talking about because they knew they
were saying the same words they were discussing the Constitution they were
discussing the Bill of Rights they were discussing the Declaration of Independence and all those things the
white man was using the very same words that the black people were using however
they were not speaking the same language simply because they had a diametrically
opposed worldview diya puts it in these
words this is the difference between xenophobia and zeno philia and that is
the European has a fear of anything different of other people and cultures
that is different from him and therefore he must control them in some manner or
eradicate them like the child who is never grown up you stop running around here healed black men or big shots of
Nubian looking black men you can snatch telephone poles up off the ground talk about I got to go to work for the man
he's not the man you the man he never
grew up and why do I say that how can I say that
I can say it because Jerusalem Zim who you call Jesus Christ be it's called him brother Jerusalem Slim in the seminary
said that it is bad the fruit of a tree that you know what that chewy is what he
produces is what you know what that tree is and the very fact that when people do
not do what he wants them to do he acts just like a little child like the demon
see either you doing it all right you well I'll take my marbles
and get out of the game most the time I wish you would just take his marbles and go about in it but in that satisfied
with doing are you got to come back and try to control the game again be perfectly all right with me because I
know left on our own we really when we have nothing else to do but on our own
we can do it and we'll do it fast we won't drag it out there but this
xenophobia this fear is the motivating factors dr. Francis Walsh and tells us
in the book the ISIS paper keys to the color is the major motivating factor of white folks now come to the holidays
where I gotta lay this groundwork here y'all be facing with
one of the reasons is because I have to constantly be defending myself with black folks because I've discussed the
historical realities of the European and I won't stop doing that black folks
wouldn't even come out to see me a lot I'm sure that some white folks come in that's why I was so glad to get here one
of the few places where I can go where I am totally in an African environment and you know moat nothing else here but
Africa now African people in their
natural state of being and most peoples of color tend to have AZ no felling
approach to life that is a love of other people in embracing of other cultures a sharing of culture so you have these two
different things so now when you celebrate European holidays whose major
motivation is the fear of his genetic annihilation his phobia of other human
beings what type of celebrations do he have those celebrations that are built around
that worldview which is essentially xenophobic when you celebrate that you
are celebrating something opposed to your very nature because you are by nature in your natural state and I'm
saying natural state now there's a lot of us didn't got out our natural that would have read the Holy Ghost as Jesus
talked about if you know what that means those who understand that them understand what has been saying and when
you are in your natural state your idea and purposes for a celebration is different so what are to deal with that
first premise you still with me you are right the second premise the
celebration of holidays establishes and helps to maintain a strong emotional and
cultural bond between you and that which you are celebrating a strong emotional
and cultural bond between you and that which you are celebrated did you jump up and down and sing about
and dance about long enough becomes very much a part of your being and you feel something for that because it brought
you joy at the time that you were doing it so you have a emotional and a cultural bond in connection with it the
question arises when we celebrate European holidays what are we binding ourselves to it's
another question on that third print on that second from the third and final premise here holiday is a very common
and natural to human beings and you should have times to celebrate I'm
involved in the African liberation struggle until I am taking home to my
ancestors unless I should lose my mind and when I think that somebody please put me out of my misery brother be
shocked a moose is no longer involved in liberation movements and you know he has gone plumb crazy and he needs to be
taken and worked with and to bring all the African centered behavioral sciences try to heal me and lock me up till I get
straighten out as long as I'm in my right mind I'm committed to the African
liberation struggle however I do not view it as a struggle as said as the African liberation movement because many
thailand brothers and sisters get the time.i we involved in the struggle to make it hard for themselves and anybody
else who may be interested in it it is a happy thing that we do those who are
participating in it we chose that this is the road we would go rather than be
manipulated and controlled by something or someone else now that's a happy choice that's a choice that a lot of
people don't even know they have so matter of fact that you made that choice
you must be a happy warrior it must be a joyful - you fight better when you're
happy even with youth when it comes to the point where you have to but enemies head off good with a smile
and by all means when you talk into your brothers and sisters always talk up
always be cold always be joy always speak the fulfillment of the promise
that has been given to our mothers and our fathers every since the days we were brought off the slave ships here they
know from generation to generation that this day would come so talking them turn I have it in my
household when I ask my children what happened they have to respond on demand so what's happening black folk on the
rise don't tell me I don't know so it's stuff like that and when they forget I
keep asking the questions that I can answer they get tired of it but at least is a part of the right programming
process transitioning process so it's natural for us to be happy and to
celebrate we started out by celebrating the harvest and on our homeland when we
created the science of Agriculture the success of the hunt the rituals and
celebrations of the rites of passage all these things are good reasons for celebration for us we have a lot to
celebrate and that we were able to survive this beast all this time in this hostile environment and still come out
with some degree of sanity I said some degree because as dr. ben says we are all crazy to some extent having been
here and survived under these conditions but we're still able to function and
also we celebrated so often victory over an enemy but never in the history of the
world have I ever heard of a people celebrating the victory of their enemies
over them do you get the point here they may remember that but they will not
celebrate here the only people I know now presently in the world is the Negro
and other people who are mentally subjugated by white supremacist culture
around the world that celebrate their enemy's defeat of them so when we study
European holidays we have to ask whose victory are we celebrating all right I
hope y'all don't get angry with me in here now I don't mean to be a killjoy
but I just have to deal with history the story our story as it is now I'm going
to attempt to and you'll have to let me know when my time is coming up cuz I just dug Vince I ain't got time watch
watch at the move with the spirit and in
the spirit world we don't know about no time you get in there but I know y'all got things doing I think so you had let
me know when I get there I I'm just goin on now we're gonna try to deal with five
European holidays some historical perspective on them and that is who
discovered Columbus because he sure
didn't discover me the second one is Halloween and I forgot
what system would assist on the radio program dr. Felder with us that day at WL IV they came up with that to touch
the Night of the Living Dead miss giving
a celebration of Horrors Xmas the merry
mess and even if I don't get to so many others I'm going to talk about America's
Independence Day the 4th of you line we'll get to that one if I won't get nothing y'all pray for me now y'all so
now goodbye brace inside in order to
deal with this who discovered Columbus and I'm starting out with the Columbus Day thing because that's how they begin
the whole holiday season here in this country that opens the whole thing up and the reason why I'm putting a lot of
emphasis on that this evening is because all this year here in 1992 they're going
to be talking about the clinton centennial of the coming of columbus and there will be bom ba-ding our children's
minds with this intimidating them with this and their peers will be looking at
them and saying why are you not into this and we have to give them a strong sound historical basis and logical basis
upon which to say I just ain't with that that name down that ain't happening for
me I dish - definitely [Music]
and this is the reason why I recommend that I didn't come here to tell you what to do or to make any choices for you
only to show you the other side of the coin some of you have already seen that side of the coin but it ain't no I heard
us to look at it again at that time
period talking about 1492 now we must assess here briefly what was going on in
the world then contrary to what we have been miss educated to believe the world
was not waiting for white folks to come and bring them Christianity civilization
or any other thing they didn't mean they didn't invite them and they weren't looking for them they did not need them
for anything whatsoever if you study what was going on in the Olmec and the
Mayan and the Aztec civilizations here and what was going on in China and India
and everywhere else around the world and on the mother continent nobody needed what white folks have to offer I want to
get that clear [Applause]
so there was nothing they could bring us but misery as history has shown why do I
say that first of all I have to go back about 700 years or so before 1492 if
y'all don't man talk about one of the great periods of the many wonderful
periods of our history on this planet and that's when the Moors left from the
motherland went over and on the island which later became known as Gibraltar
under devour Tariq and from their base of operations and their fourth there on
the rock of Hercules between the Pillars of Hercules as they call it they move
now into Spain they were 80% indigenous
jet-black broad nose thick lip kinky hair Africa that is what the documents
of history say not what I say this is empirical evidence we're talking about
here 20% so-called semitic arabs who
joined in the semitic Arabs or Muslims had nothing to bring to the Muslims on
the mother land when they left out of Arabia when and were traveling around
for their conquest they left with a little more knowledge than how to raise
camels and how does they have her cheek it was only after they went in conquered
Egypt that they now come out with this new life and knowledge this resurrection
of the old classics and and the zero and all that and it was the indigenous
Africans still living and what came to be miss Naaman is Egypt in CHEM it there which introduced him and taught them
just like they had taught the Greeks the Romans and everyone else who had conquered them for a spacer here tells
us they conquer us Miller but we always conquered them culturally
and scientifically before we had the knowledge to do that why even in slavery
they had to depend on the black slave to teach them how to do things so even though we were their slave
we still had to conquer them morally and intellectually I want you to think about
that they didn't have to teach us how to read and write we first got it we already know how to do that it was only
in next generations where they have taken that from but we had to come back and learn that again most of them who
brought us here couldn't read and write now at the time that these Africans went
into Spain not five kings or queens throughout all of Europe and any of
their nations could read or write not five were literate and couldn't anybody
read the Bible but a few of the priests who could read and it was chained to the wall so that only they could read it the
common people did not have it I'm trying to get you these good god-fearing people with these halos around their head it
came to go over here killed up the indigenous red man and captured us and brought us the light of God and
Christianity in Jesus most of them
didn't know it so how can a teacher said anything about now when the Moors came in they brought with them the light of
knowledge and established the first universities there they also taught geography from goals that's a matter of
record they taught from goals and even after they taught in Spain for some 800 years
the Spanish still believed that the world was flat hard people to teach
and if you haven't learned that by now as a song and see if you don't know about now you'll never know it why am I
going through all this because the African had been sailing ships up and
down and now up and down the niger up and down the senegal river for
thousands of years navigational science was a way of life to him that kind of
knowledge did not exist in Europe before the Africans before the Moors went and
took it to Europe I'm sorry we did it but it happened now in 1310 monza
mohammed abu bakr r.a ii look out over
the ethiopian see it wasn't called the atlantic ocean there was the Ethiopian
see how do I know that because I looked at the maps of the of the 15th in the
16th century Dan and others have looked
at he looked out over the sea he said if we can navigate the Niger he was need
for impre of the Mali Empire at that time he said if we can navigate the
Sahara Desert we can deal with that he'll see Oh death
so he went to work building he went the work building with a knowledge which had
been preserved by the University of Sankar a and Timbuktu and other
university systems right there in the motherland and he sent out 200 ships 100
with cruise of Africans and 100 for supplies to carry him for two years of
necessary now I mean if you think you can go on an ocean for two years you bad stuff you
know something because the man loves this people he was responsible for the people he was a leader she he wouldn't send him out somewhere not Norway was
sending them and he told him say don't stop till you come to land I know
there's land over there because our people have been traveling over there ever since the days of the Pharaohs and
possibly before some time passed by and only one ship came back and the ship
captain that came back according to the report given by Abu Bakar a successor
says that his report went thusly saya we traveled and we followed the wind gust
that would take us straight across the Ethiopian sea but we reached a place
where there was a great churning River and I'm an awesome mist and all the
other ships went into that mist and I never saw them again we somehow had spent out of it and we're headed back in
this direction so we came home so what did abu bakar ii ii knew in 1311 I'd say
30 but what year in SA 1310 now we have 13 11 but how far is that from 1492 13
11 now this black man says hook me up
phone running ships 202 care people and
200 the caste class and I'll see you later he gave him five
and got in the wind after
Empress ship on monster come conga no Musa
he will never heard from on the continent again but the records of the Aztecs - all makes and some of the other
people there recorded that a strange group appeared on their land hundreds
upon hundreds of black men wood gold spears and golden shields and one tall
jet black man with gold in it braids in his hair golden slippers stood under a
golden provision and the indigenous out and said hail our God the coral has
returned
[Applause] that's in 1311 now for I can back up to
30 or 1492 yard all right okay I don't want to bore you with all this definitely before I get up 1492 I got a
couple of a couple more dates because it's impossible to talk about Columbus without a whole bunch of other names
coming up before you of course we know courtiers Fernandez Balboa and all the
rest of them none of them were noble people they were not noble men they were criminals cdolls pirates and deserve no
honour from us but also there is prince henry the navigator bartolomé against
Vasco de Gama and Jan von Raab back because at the
time now that they were preparing when they were about to drive out I got to
come back to 1492 and then switch back home and I'll be coming back and forth but you can hang with me the last
stronghold of the Moors who had been there for some 800 years and as Doctor John Henry Clark said it was one of the
few times that Africans had partnerships with other people and they came out alright for a while
Derrick's betrayed us in the end the Jews we brought into Europe helped to
get us out of the black Jews we brought in undermining us with the Spanish to
help the downfall of the last stronghold of the Moorish Empire of the kingdom of
Granada in 1492 the same year that your
boy made his child got lost
when they drove the Moors out of Spain this is what they declared we cannot
afford to be embarrassed by the superior intelligence of these people any longer
they must not be allowed to get themselves strengthened and come back here again
the day will never rise again and the only way to stop them is to go to the lands from which they emanate and stop
them we couldn't do that before because we did not know how to navigate the sea we did not know how to build ships but
now that we have run them out of here we can take the knowledge that they left behind and we can now go and exploit the
world not explore the world exploit the world and in that way we can continue to
ensure our genetic survival and so in
1444 prince having Henry the Navigator
leaves out of Portugal and heads down the west coast of our capable name
commonly known as Africa because the Portuguese were heading for Africa the
Italians and the French and the Germans were still trading with the East but
Spain couldn't get through to the east because they would have had to fight the Germans the French and the Italians to
do it here would I had to fight the Portuguese to get to Africa so Spain said the only place for us to go is West
no place else to go but we got to find some land to exploit or the other nations around us and I become so strong
and so rich and they will whip us and subjugate us to them these Europeans thought my fight among Europeans now
Prince Henry the Navigator comes down to the Congo and takes back begins
immediately after taking back four of Mother Africa's children begins to
recommend the slave trade from there to bring in import Africans into slavery into Portugal in 1487 to 1488 but
Ptolemy ideas another Portuguese rounded the Cape of what they call Good Hope and
southern our cable land Antonia because I don't know where South Africa is I look on a map I cannot find
it I know I am Sania is that's what the people were struggling there for their
liberation calling then in 1497 Vasco de
Gama rounded that cape and found the route they were looking forward to India what was these people were going hungry
they were suffering from diseases they would be decimated by the plague and everything else so they were going to other lands to find medicines to find
other things for their own survival they were not going to carry the light of civilization they were not going to
bring people to Jesus they were not going for any of those reasons they were
going for economic reasons and strictly survival reasons that's what it was all
about that's why I said when they tell your children in school about the the great explorers know they were
exploiters we're not explorers but here's the kicker I'm gonna be back to
1492 in a minute in 1652 the Dutch East
India Company which with trading in the slaves most of his money was made from slave trade of African slaves sent in a naval
surgeon named John Van Ryback and he established the first white settlement
and an zania known as Cape Town now why am I going through all that because
African children there who are compelled
by the MIS education system the white supremacist mis-education system of the
USA there the United the Union of South Africa same initials as United States of
America tell these children that they must celebrate the arrival of Vasco de
Gama mcdonough mule deer and John Van Riper
their arrival opened up the door for the destruction of their civilization and
the state that they're in now now that is mental and cultural genocide
however many of us here have no problem
seeing that in relationship to an Xenia but we have a problem seeing it in
relationship to our experience here in America and I say and I hope I can back
it up there to tell our children to celebrate Columbus Day is the same as
telling our brothers and sisters on the continent to celebrate the arrival of John van ride back the same equation now
why do I say that let me give you a little background on Christopher here my
notes down good low background on him
first of all his name was Cristobal Cologne he was a Jew a Jew
his parents were Jews born in Spain who
were baptized Jews Christianized Jews to survive there in Europe because the
Europeans were running the Jews although I mean they were giving him hell they're in Europe I have to say that he was a
Christian eyes Jew who were born to a mother and father who was in the weaving business at the age of 14 he became a
sailor and it settled in Genoa Italy now
in his travels to the west coast of Africa and other ships he had sailed on
he learned about several things one he
learned about the Moors having taught that the earth was round from the goats they taught geography
when they were in Spain and they were still using now and the at the universities in West Africa he also
purchased a map that was used by the Moorish sea kings who had mapped out the
route going across the Ethiopian sea coming here to what was later to be
missing I'm at the Americas this was very precious you ever read in those
comic books about finding a map that shows you hidden treasure and people hold it and say god that's what he did
with that that's why he could run around saying to the other ignorant one the world is round give me some money and
I'll prove it well how you know that but I can't let you know just give me some money he was selling from the
information economic thing when he came
to I'm not gonna go through the whole story there with him but when he came to Isabella and Ferdinand to with his plan
they originally had rejected him but there was one person who came and saved
the day for Columbus and his name was Louise de santander a baptized Jew who
was finance minister to Ferdinand and he said to Isabella who said well now I
don't have that much maybe I can to finance a venture like this I can pawn my jewels you know we heard in school
that she pawned her jewels no she didn't he told it you don't have to do that because I have a cartel of moneylenders
why did he have a cartel a moneylender because one of the few businesses that Jews were allowed to engage in in Europe
was pawn broking money lending and therefore they developed a mercantile
class which gave them outreach and connections and networking with other
nations so by the day I can hook up that by the time of the Rothschilds spread
everywhere all over Europe and they had to finance every or that Europe went into there now he
goes to his cartel which consists of Don Isaac Abravanel one Cabrero and Abraham
senior all Jews they raised ninety eight
thousand dollars to get the three ships for Columbus to come over here on his
way over here he has to stop go down because you can't come over unless you went down the west coast of Africa and
one of the reasons why I went to the west coast of Africa is is a brother he had met when he was there before that
would be most vital to that mission that lived in Sierra Leone his name was Pedro
Alonso Nena one of the most celebrated navigators in
the world at that time put him upon the ship either the Pinta
the Nina I don't remember which one now Santa Maria thank you and they now come
over the only way over here but they don't go further enough to the south and the wind can't carry him directly to
Brazil so they're delayed for some time it's an arduous journey the journey is
so bad that the crew threatens to mutiny
and they tell him if we don't see some land soon we're gonna throw your butt
off the ship and we're going back to Spain because cologne said the king
queen told him he said man I can't go back without something they don't give me this money because he made them
promise to make him Admiral of the sea and that he could get 10% of everything
he could steal once he got here there's a economic venture now I'm telling you
so now he comes he's almost not far from land they're
about to commit mutiny and I understand I'm told that Pedro Alonso Nena looks all for his ship and he sees floating in
the water Squidward leaves on it and some blossoms which is a sure sign that they're not farming land so he says hold on no
mutiny yet we gotta be near land and see something like that and in a few hours later they do see land I'm not proud of
it but the brothers say Kristopher colognes behind right then and there now
when he gets here this is the report he
gives to Spain when he returns he leaves
a large portion of his crew here on the island of what was to come become known as Haiti I want you to keep that in mind
to him come back to that in a minute you all right they're all so quiet out there very boring
when he gets to bring his report back to Spain I know I'm hopping around quite a
bit but I'm trying to cover a lot in a few minutes here and I read from African people in European holidays mineral
genocide book 1 page 32 this is the report that Christopher cologne made to
his sovereigns in Spain he's describing
the people he encountered here the people he what that means the people
that were were already here as one comedian said you can't discover nobody
who don't want to be discovered how you gonna discover something is already today he says this so tractable so
peaceful are these people that I swear to your Majesty's there is not in the
world a better nation do you hear what he said in this white man that was supposed to have to come to these
savages and stop him from eating up each other and teaching about God and everything and civilizing he's saying he
has never encountered a better nation and what he encountered of these people here they love their neighbors as
themselves what he said I thought we had to wait until the white man come to teach us that love your neighbor as
yourself that's a part of the Christian doctrine love your neighbor as yourself these people already had it
didn't anybody to bring it tor was already here and their discourse is ever
sweet and gentle and accompanied with a smile and though it is true that they are naked now to Europeans anybody
wasn't covering for me at the toe was naked look as Francis Thierry they had a problem with their own physical body
African people have people who kind of like to get that son get that rock into him women could walk around bare breasts
because they would not be disrespected nobody with this region can do that today because of my mind's been twisted
all out of shape but it was nobody would think to disrespect an African woman who knows
was unheard of and it could cost you your life some community said today it
can cost you your life say though they're naked yet their manners are the chorus and praise worthy Columbus goes
on to recommend that these friendly and hospitable people be made to work and
sew and do all that is necessary to adopt our ways do you take that [ __ ]
arrogance to adapt our way the people were all right the way they were they
didn't need anything from him after
which he displayed the tent I know Indians he had captured and brought to Spain now on his second voyage back I've
got to read something to you is that all right and so some people won't call me a
racist and reverse I'm gonna read from a white man this time okay we'll derive
the story of civilization vol 6 this is what he wrote about it when Columbus
returned on his second voyage after he had left this colony of Spaniards they
are on the island of Haiti he returns now and person hold on again to this
island to see what had happened what had taken place while he was gone making his
report to Spain this is his second journey now and it says here that ten
months after leaving these people there that hardly a man remained of the colony
remained of it the Europeans and this is in will Durant's language now had roamed
the island robbing the natives of gold and women they had established a
tropical paradise with five women to each man they had horror and murder
one another and nearly all the rest have been killed by the outraged Indians now
the brothers had open up the alum say come on in there's plenty you know we'll share these folk act is so bad they made
the Bloods bad and they start killing them which was their right to do they
said it should have slain them at the bay in the first place I'm not talking
violence I'm not talking agent I'm talking our survival [Music]
he goes on to write he turned back to
Ward's Haiti October he left another colony there now and he went on to explore some other islands right it
looked for some other islands to explore because up until this time he hadn't found with anything to take home but those 10 indigenous indigenized there
which they called Indians there and in Isabella and Ferdinand said you better come up with something more than that
because we got to pay this 98 out now the baculum Jews so you better come up with something that I can go get it he
turned back towards Haiti October the 29th 1494 wondering how his new
settlement had fared he was shocked to find that it had behaved like its predecessor that the
Spaniards had raped Native women stolen Native stores of food and kidnapped
native boys to serve as slaves and that the natives had killed many Spaniards in
revenge Columbus himself now became a slave dealer let me read that again
listen very carefully to this written by will derive one of the four doctor will
put her on one of the foremost European historians in the story of civilization
volume 6 page 265 if you don't have it
go to labra and check it out Lisa Columbus himself now became a slave
holder he sent out expeditions to capture 1,500 natives
400 of these he gave to settlers 500 he dispatch to Spain 200
of these died on the voyages the survivors were sold at Seville but died in a few years unable to adjust
themselves to the colder climate or perhaps to the savagery of civilization
[Music]
brother zerorez cyclization civilization
the third settlement that he left here had survived but one of every four of
the 500 Spanish years that he left there in 1496 was suffering from syphilis and
the settlers had divided into two hostile groups that were now on the verge of war these focus love war to
appease the discontent Columbus allowed each man to appropriate a large tract of land and to enslave the natives dwelling
on it this became the rule in Spanish settlements with him on this voyage in
1498 as he crossed the Ethiopian sea he
passed Africans on their way back home carrying cargo and when he got it he
said what was that I started him the Frederick's from over there they've been coming to some people they've been
coming here a long time they brought us some gold we gave him some things they took back we'd be back late they do that
all the time with him was one of the
most infamous creatures that has ever walked on the face of the earth Bishop Bartolomeu las Casas
he looked at the situation he said these people can't stand up on a hard labour
they may they live and enjoy life they fish they hunt they weave they make rugs
and things they can't stand on apart of that hard labor we're gonna have to look
somewhere else say Nana Portuguese have Africans and they can do the work of 10
of these Indigo's as they got so then he went to the Pope of Rome The Vicar of
the Son of God on earth who once wrote
in their catechism Pope Leo 2:10 said the Lord our God no longer reigns he has
given all power to me I'm not picking on him at religious destinies who has the
keys to the kingdom walk in the shoes a decision and got permission to capture
and enslave African people and bring them to the Spanish colonies which
opened the whole door to the slave trade became the basis of America's economy which we'll be talking about later on
they're my brothers and sisters I present to you the question is it
logical is it same for us for our children to celebrate the arrival of a
slaver a person who dealt in the slave trade a person will open the door for
the genocide and destruction not only of the red nations here but the black nations that were here as well and then
on the heels of that to capture our ancestors in the bring them here and to
subject them to the worst cruelty that has ever been known in the history of the entire world there is nothing to
match this this is the greatest of all Holocaust would they tell me somewhere between 150
to 200 thousand million lost in the Middle Passage alone not to mention the
suffering wreaked in the destruction on all of the civilizations which were existing there on the continent and the
pain and deprivation after we were brought here so is there that that one
move Columbus opened the door to the Western Hemisphere for that kind of
activity so what is there to celebrate in that hope you don't get angry with me
for sharing that with you I'm gonna leave that alone now we move on to the next holiday y'all all right
[Applause] let's talk about Halloween night of the
living day yes sir oh I thought my time
was up now in order to get to this I'm gonna
have to go a little further back in history now we went back to 1310 7/11 I'm gonna have to go all the way back
200,000 VP now don't get upset because I guess you think and say this brother
have talked from 7-eleven and it took him all this time to get to 1492 how
long I'm gonna take him to give him to an adoption back then well I won't be able to give as much detail I'm just
gonna touch on something but I think it's important to lay this sound historical basis to demonstrate the
dichotomy here that I'm talking about in reference to this Night of the Living Dead now paleoanthropologist
anthropology and whole bunch of other scientists are not agreed totally on the
fact that Homo habilis which existed some 2 million years ago on the count
mother continent what's really a human being or not there's still some discussion over that but the one thing
we do know for certain that no sane anthropologist can argue with is that by
200 thousand years ago human beings Homo
sapiens sapiens modern human beings had developed and they developed nowhere else but on the continent of a key moon
land now that is a fact that only a fool would try to dispute that has been proven in so many ways to
the genetic system of the biology system
I'm trying to think of a term for that field through osteology through so many
poring over the bones through all kind of ways they have come to that biogenetics that's what it is now
these people who live some 200,000 years ago produced out of this woman who was
to become the mother of all humanity this queen of the universe who was that
all humans and some of her children I'm sure if you don't want today but
everybody can trace the ancestry back to this woman so naturally they can trace
it back to this woman and women can't have children by themselves they must be able to trace it back to a black man in
Africa they sometime between 90,000 and
150,000 years ago and shake the hunted deer puts it on in 50,000 began to
migrate out of the mother continent to
other places in the world and they covered the globe at that time they took
with them according to dr. Rebecca Kahn of the University hope of whyyy they
took with them and it's special advantage that nobody else on earth had
at the time they were more advanced than anyone else and I do detail that in my book African woman the original guardian
angel there and go more in depth on what I'm talking about you know they
encountered another group that it was existent on earth at the time Homo
neanderthalensis who we're not sure whether they were actually human or what
is that argument over what they were they were still pigmented of skin very
dark however those that lived in Africa had a black hair covering or dark brown
those who lived in Palestine in Asia had a sort of tannish color and those in
Europe had a reddish color after being there for some time now the great great warm Galatian came as you know
organization came about it of the Ice Age they're about 125,000 years ago and
after that we find no more of them about 35 thousand years ago they become extinct
now either through the recessive genes process they become who appears about
20,000 years ago or they disappear and this group known as the nubian Grimaldi
who had traveled there in Europe about 40,000 years ago become bleached out and
the cro-magnon after the Ice Age what I'm saying in essence there was no record of any local derm that's people
without skin color on the face of the earth nor no Caucasian whatsoever before
between 20 and 25,000 years ago and we have a history of African people for at
least 200,000 years now why am i raising all this fuss here about that this is
the reason the nubian Grimaldi when they went there into Europe and in Siberia in
the other places we find that their bones and their artwork we find that
they had a burial custom and system which the later cro-magnon the immediate
predecessor of the Caucasian race did not have it was a long time before Caucasians practice burial they
practiced our on cremation because they were nomadic they weren't sedentary
people they didn't settle on land Africans had a penchant for land and settling on land no matter how harsh the
conditions they will make that land work for them because they had an atonement with Maya now in their burry of systems the Nubian
Grimaldi showed ritual there is evidence left behind of the rituals to their
ancestors they had a love of and adoration for their departed because to
the African until we were brainwashed and conditioned by invaders there was no
such concept as death you understand what I'm saying to you there was only
the cycle of life the passing of the rites of passage and that even though
you left your physical body it went back to the atoms and molecules to the cosmos only to return some time
and future children of future generations or maybe tomorrow at the negative comment in while you leave it
out how many times have you looked in the face of your children and saw your mother and your grandmother and your
granddaddy and so forth that's because the African never died so if you never
died there is no fear of death and that's why our warriors and soldiers of the past with such fearsome warrior
because they didn't have a concept of death and you can't threaten a person with death you can't threaten with nothing
[Music]
[Applause] contrary to that once again now we see
this difference of worldview the Europeans who came later they're to be
known as the cause a lot of time to go into all the history of it now it's a lot I cover that in African people in
European holidays ameno genocide book - there came another group of Africans
into that area of Europe known as Iberian between 8,000 and 3,000 before
the Common Era and they came to be known as the Kelty Liberians they were
Kushites who came there they were driven some of them further north some of them
to Wales and further western back down in Africa by the invasion of the posterity of the Citians who used to go
to war wearing a black cape buck naked that's his dark and the first person
they slew in battle they jumped on a bit of except now blood guess what a whole concept or the vampire come from the
Greeks later followed that up by going to battle nakedness you you can look in there and so many pictorial books put
out by time life and and they were going about our necks with
just occasion and shield and the helmet because the first person they came across they are committed homosexual act
with them as a symbol of total conquest so my brothers we should find ourselves
incarcerated in those concentration camps we not Greeks we Bea's Africa and
we do not allow ourselves to be degenerated to the level of a beast so we tuck our nature under we put iron
nature in the hands of the creator and we let our spirit and mind take over
because the one doing the pounding is as bad as the one that's been over you both
[ __ ] [Applause]
one since the Sapphire find out about that she should never had nothing to do with you ever again in life
Oh brothers don't like it when I talk
like that when I go to the prison about telling that man you up in there doing
some of everything and when you get out you're gonna come home and endanger these women no telling what you bringing in if you can't act like you supposed
act and be a man you don't deserve no woman that's a blessing
not a privilege blessing let me get off at a minute and then brothers I'm not
coming up I'm a brother we don't get this thing set right will never be men
if we don't view these women the way they supposed to be viewed and treated we will never be men not ever it is
impossible to come to that unless you treat your mama right and every African woman at some time it's your mama
just like you her father in some capacity and I'm saying that because I
didn't mean the kid in that advocated that you can read it in African woman the original guardian angel it does not
mean that the woman is greater that a man and a man is better than a woman African people rule the world
side-by-side as equals we're getting taught all up in there [Music]
that's the European problem maybe we can
deal with that in a question-and-answer I can't get into it now let me get on down I've got an office
object let me get back now when these Citians now began to drive the other
Europeans the Teutons and the Jutes and the angles and some of the other other
Germanic drive them West they now put pressure on the Liberians that were
there the black folks who were there and when they took over they also co-opted
the great culture that these black folks had these were the folks who built Stonehenge and so many other of the
megaliths up there in Europe and I didn't write there some English
historians out of the latter half of the 19th century journal Massey and Albert
church boy and sir Godfrey Higgins who says he was exasperated by the fact that every time he went to study the origin
of nations he always ended up in something black that's what he said is in there and antic ellipsis book one for
a long time you couldn't even get a copy of it we stirred it up so bad they figure well let's better make that money
we can always try to take knowledge from them later they don't know this is a different time well they came in and
they came to be known as kelp so you had two types of Celts you had the black Celts who brought the bagpipe and
everything a bagpipe and everything comes out of an African tradition and you see it with the African a scientific
symbol of the God best there and the wearing of the kilts that was brought in by African people
well they co-opted that culture and they became there with the Britain and the
Gaulish Celts most of them settled in Britain and involved now out of them
there came a group of priests known as druids who took the knowledge that was
left behind by the Africans and once again co-opted and corrupted it and in
place of ancestor reference they came up with shall win or sharleen's
this festival of the Dead or Satan's Sabbath that's what it is called and
during this festival now note the contrast Africans pour libation and
invite their ancestors to come please come be with us come join us
there are festivals of holidays and celebration we invite our ancestors right Europeans say please don't come
stay keep you behind and round because on October the 31st which was
their new year it was believed that the first opened up in the center all the day it came out is God harassing
everybody goblins and ghosts and stuff
and they figured the only way they could play Kaden was to give them gifts and
that's where the trick-or-treat came from and when that wouldn't work they
even painted their driveways a different color so that they could throw them off they wouldn't come back to their house for money they figured they'd put on
costumes and look like something with somebody else they could throw them off this is where our Halloween costume
thing comes from all the other different world feel we talking about this only
got a different understanding about things we love our department because we
know no did they're our ancestors we love and adore them and invite them to be with us they scared to death of the
day they got a placate today another
group they were frightening because the whole European historical experience and I'm not being hateful or racist and
reversing all that kind of fortunate I'm telling historical truth the whole
motivation of the European throughout his history has been fear fear of
everything and everybody fear how do I know that if you don't that open the
King James Version of the Bible and you will read fear God and give glory to him
that is not the way it was originally written it was honor God and give glory
to him but he put fear because fear in honor or wanting the same thing to him
so working out of that fear also as a part of the symbolism of Halloween or
Hallows Eve we find gnomes fairies brownies and
and actually they were the toir people who lived up in Scandinavia these black
people who knew how to who were metallurgist and with doctors new
medicine knew so many things that the druids and others didn't know so they figured they were magical
so in those fairy tales they're talking about the magical Africa many times the
dwarfs in and then there were sharp people smart people and they could do
all those things and they didn't make the weapon they were just like so they feared them so that death is a chose
they're a diametric difference of world feel you still with me okay I'm trying to get off this on some
of the others as quick as I can all right witches any woman that knew something
that a white man didn't know whether she was Black Hawk white was a witch in Europe you have to take my word for it
you just go and read the history of Europe how many women who hadn't
committed any crime with burnt at the stake for just eating an apple there was
some ignorant people man they couldn't teach us anything [Applause]
some black because you talk so bad about the white man I'm just telling the history and if they had and I could wait
he wouldn't have to get down on it like that but I mean now you know it's out there I'm not backing up off it I'm not
gonna carry his burden around he got to pay for that I got a planet to redeem I got time
messing on him I brought him the religion of Assad
which they call a Cyrus and he said he was gonna do better when I converted him to that and then he co-opted co-opted
and messed it up I'm boarding the religion of a Buddha and he said oh yeah
I'll get into that and I'll be a better person he messed that up exterminated as many
Buddhists as he couldn't set up ramen ramen is bought in the religion of
Judaism under Moses he messed data brought him Christianity he showed mass
data brought him Islam and he fooled and I
got him a time for the cab man anybody
I've been fighting for 20,000 years man I'm time and we've been fighting 20,000
years we've been able to settle this stuff man we gonna settle it that's it so you go on your way and I'm going my way I said thank God that this
the energy after all you know made the lifespan so shocked that I ain't got the
time to spend the average African when the Greeks when Herodotus went into an
Africa when he finally were allowed to come into Africa when the Greeks came
into Africa they found Africans living to be the average of 120 years old in
the heyday of the Roman Empire according to Ripley's Believe It or Not 22 years
Oh was the average lifespan anybody living to be 50 years old and Europe was
automatically a god if you were 18 you were divine but here's the thing man
I'm gonna get back to the witches in a minute that's the problem with a
preacher and a historian the to get mixed up in there something you know
that really made me mad though because I'm home on into 20 man
don't stare I'm saying you have 22 and I
have 120 now I'm lucky if I make it to 65 oh we got to change this we are
change it you didn't do me no good no good now you can get nails with me I
just reading a book on gerontology and the doctors are saying that you should be able to live to be 120 years old
easily very easily how can we not get that in our community in our
neighborhood because we don't control the means of production we don't control
the land that we live on we don't control what comes into our community that we have to sustain ourselves with
that's why no I ain't giving up nothing don't and with my people man when you
finish when you can gave them all the love they supposed to have you ain't got nothing left
so these witches now who had this a women were African women were the
founders of stuff of the sciences of the world and they taught them to the men
brothers don't be upset about that when we document that you know dr. Benton taught you that in many other started a
documented that I had to wrestle with it first myself when he first revealed it to me so I know it's the reality made me
a better man for it and the black cat who's always accompanied showing with
the witches was a symbol of an African deity known as Haru the mother of the
harvest and one of her symbols was the apple and an apple tree
so that's why the two were associated together when I say some of my students
call it the barrage angle dictum because one of the things that are taught in my
classrooms is usually what is good for us is bad to them and what is good to
them is bad for us they ear reckons the theory of
irreconcilable opposites that's what I call me everybody else got theories I guess I have one i'ma deal with just one
more cuz I'm gonna get off of this and get into another holiday or two if I got time yeah yeah all right but I can't
leave here without talking about the pin the tail on the donkey and what that
means now when you hear your children run around a plan with blindfold on pin
tail on donkey this is what it means historically
on Satan's Sabbath and other festivals
of the Druids they selected a jackass or goat and that goat was blessed and
sanctified to represent Satan because up there at that time there was no difference between Satan and God in Europe making difference Christianity
hadn't come in or any of the other things so they're making difference to them and as a part of the ritual you
were blindfolded and you had to show that you were a committed devotee to
shaman or Satan by kissing the donkey
all the goat smack down in the middle
don't take shots lose the word for it they have wood carvings with that on it
they have it in art books of Old Europe when they show that taking place you
don't want to go to that buried look some of them things up you'll see it and some of the encyclopedias on Halloween
they will show it to you some other people have written books on when the
Romans came in in 55 before the Common Era under Julius Caesar and in 46 on the
Claudius Caesar they modified that with one of their rituals which was the
Kissin of the tail of the horse at the
temple of Pomona they didn't have to go with smack-dab in the middle just the
hail on the tail but some kissing with that I wonder if that's where we got
there for saying that and we can say it
too and be serious especially since the
sister can say very Miami so we ought to
think about therefore we say to head to each other so they brought the tail and
so now instead of the child walking up blindfold kissing the things back dab in the middle of the behind it pin the tail
on it so that's what your children are vicariously doing when that happens brothers and sisters let me move on we
talked about misgiving for a minute all right got a second on that why do I call
it misgiving day a celebration of Horrors because first of all the good
Pilgrim Fathers that you hear so much about were actually homeless people
looking for somewhere to stay not that there's anything evil about
that there's a lot of good people out there that's homeless today but these suckers have been thrown out of Europe
and we're considered to be criminals they didn't come over here to bring the
midnight it heathen the gospel dispensation and they introduced them to
Jesus they got some money to get the
ship the Speedwell and the Mayflower and the people will put up the money syndrome when you get this in this
backfires oh you can take whatever you can take the paid is money back then we
make profit off this venture well speed Weldon million on the Mayflower got here and as Will Rogers
said white man said the pilgrims got off the Mayflower hit the shore fell on
their knees and thank God got up and fell on the Indians and that's exactly what they did nothing here presents I
want you to check this out a minute man I know son you already know this but
promotion you already noticed now dr. fellows and spread the books all their way but it did not hurt us to go
over it again because every year you go over to George Washington chopped down a cherry tree which was absolutely never told a lie which was a lie you can't be
a general without practicing deception diversionary tactics is a lie making a person think you over there when you
over there doesn't lie and say this man never told a lie I mean generals at the lab the wind was
and he went very few then when any action until the black folks got never
does another story and I'm not proud of that either but check this out these people come
here now they dock outside on the ship to Mayflower and 42 men of the 120 some
odd people they have aboard on in 30 42 white males make a compact to decide
what is going to happen in this land they didn't ask anybody who was living here what was going to happen
they decided it white male ego decided
not that I'm letting a female off the hook cuz I ain't she spawns her seducing
nurtures them they get here they're hungry they're starving they don't know
what to do to survive and who welcomes them even after the Columbus experience
who welcomes them the indigenous red man come on in brother will feed you will
take him he does it for a year when that year is up the pilgrims go back out to
their ship after building them a log cabin they put her cannon on top of that log cabin that is directed after Indian
village I'm just using that Turner for convenience because I don't like the term I'm just using African beats right
now in 1621 they had their first Thanksgiving celebration for having
survived and governor Bradford of the Massachusetts colony wrote that most of over 40 some of them had died and
scarcely 5 or 6 remain sane who was there the rest of them were totally crazy man
he wrote that that's what that's documented it's not the archive nothing
got it by the next celebration of Thanksgiving
this is what took place it was a red man who brought the venison and brought the
turkey and all those things you you you you see these things with the pilgrim and his stovepipe hat and stuff bill
done I'm in the turkey smiling walking beside him in the Indians flipping and dancing because he's so happy this white
man had brought him God in Jesus you
said in the classroom just like I did when they would talk about the tomb with tears running down your eyes the Pope
though I'm quoting in that prolific
historian and writer professor Joel a Rogers here and he says that the early
American White's were cruel Connecticut White's massacred the Pequot Indians
infants were torn from their mothers breasts and hacked to pieces the heads
of the parents were chopped off and kicked about in the streets maybe where the Thanksgiving Thursday football game
governor Bradford wrote it was a fearful sight to see them frying in the fire and
streams of blood crunching the same and terrible was distension a stink thereof
but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice and they the whites gave praise
thereafter god I don't think I need to say any more about it miss giving day
now that was enough for me they were
some of the lowest most deterrent of people they sit over here to these colonies were mostly criminals they
emptied out new gay friend of a prison Oxford gore and a whole bunch of others day the Daughters of the American
Revolution were [ __ ] prostituting harlot said over you that's what they
spawn in America and you wonder why the American government even today in 1991
can't do right they have a criminal element in them well they can't keep
crime cooled out because they are criminals they're probably more tolerant
of crime than any other nation in the world doesn't if subconscious they know what their history goes back to Billy
the Kid and all those criminals Jesse James with their heroes all criminals
Paul say daily old and Pizarro hero criminals committing genocide get people's so that's enough about Miss
giving day that's going to excellence me I know I don't have much longer
[Applause] I don't want you to think I'm unhappy
man I'm a happy man I'm happy first of all cuz I'm an African every morning I
wake up I look in the mirror and I say thank you and I mean that when lose or
draw when black people make me mad and it can make me so mad I still happy to be in Africa it's still my blood the
greatest experience I've ever had in my whole entire life was the African experience I have not always had the
African experience I'm a born again African so they didn't always know I was a man and since I've been born again to
the African is it is the most wondrous experience I've ever had and in the study of our history is just so
overwhelming to me it just takes me out and this is a drop in the bucket
we haven't even began to study this our scholars is great and wonderful as they
are haven't even touched the surface and they know that we all know that look
what we have to be quick to our children now the tank an opened up the Bulls out the barn now you can't do that you can't
shut the hell this is best going on leave us alone they're gonna fall down
God's anger on them and he gonna use us to demonstrate it now when we get to
Xmas the merry mess I know some of y'all really get mad with
me about dama because I got to admit I mean the music and all that I mean it's
um it's the way they portray it it's pretty man I mean it's different
pretty I like the music and every year I used to go to see the Nutcracker Suite
in fact I conducted the Nutcracker Suite I still like the music but when I
studied it went into an historic didn't find out what it was all about that was based in the Satanism practices once
again of the Druids and all that now I don't have time to go on that tonight but I do discuss it in the book there
was several questions that came up and one was first of all it is not the birthday of Jesus first of all it is not
Jesus been Joseph of the house of Panther maybe you might wanna question me on that what's a black man and I have
we have and purple we're not saying it because we would like it to be so because it makes us feel good to think
that it is historical fact you can't get around even Billy Graham when they put
him on the point in the 66 well now what color was Jesus he said uh swa-- the--
so they stopped this there okay so well it really doesn't make any difference no
cause he was for everybody so they went on with that the swath used the German works watts for black that's what it was
you can't get around there so here now they take the life of a black prophet a
liberator because SG and Brandon in his book Jesus and the zealots a white theologian and
Manchester University he begins the book with the first paragraph the only thing known for certain about
Jesus of Nazareth is that he was crucified as a rebel against the Roman Empire and Donovan joy
says everything else is theological conjecture now that may be the only
thing that mr. Brandon knows but while I was reading mr. Brandon I also read mr.
Rogers and mr. Rogers says moreover the word Christ comes from the Indian word
Krishna which means the black one and also having studied history knew that he
came from the tribe of Judah which was the navy blue black tribe of the children of Israel and the only one who
could reign as a king and be received as a true prophet was he who was kissed of
the Sun because the Israelites like the Bible says in Amos the ninth chapter in the seventh verse are you not unto me as
the Ethiopians and the Egyptians o Israel we hope the same racial stock but
we don't have time to go on a detail but in God the Bible a black liberation struggle I get documentation for that they tell me they use that book and some
seminaries around this country it was an underground movement going on and those young ministers said we come out we're
gonna start interjecting this to the people and in some denominations they have a groundswell coming up with a ton
and they got to take that your rope century white supremacist imagery down out of the church
so as they're pushing for that the reason why they told me when I met with
them they said brother shocker you wanted a pioneers here and we appreciate what you didn't even know that was going
on they said the reason why we seem to be moving slow brother is because and
I've no wife but some brothers stood up and we tell the people and lost their whole congregation so they say we're
going slow and feeding them a little at a time
what brother get up preacher you can see I'm crazy it don't make me no different you know if you come I'm happy if you
don't come I got do it anyways of the day I die even if I French to the finches I got it do it one brother
preacher was preaching on Jesus of the African and it's involving a liberation
struggle and the next week is church was empty last time I saw him he's walking
up and down in front of white houses the same that's what they did joy man here
you have a black man who was crucified or assassinated for rising up and
seeking his people to establish a kingdom of heaven on earth which is a
nation not kingdom in heaven the kingdom of heaven fighting for liberation from
the white woman power structure and the Romans didn't crucify him as a new prophet they didn't crucify him as God
or the Son of God or the organizer of a new religion what does it said he stirred up the people the charge was
inciting to riot that's what the charge was everything else came later after
Europeans to be mobile he became any and everything now they fought over these different days once the earth that
caused it began as the African Christian Church and the Europeans took it Rome took it militarily
now after a boosting and an Origin and turtley and and others had taught them
which they shouldn't have done in the first place we always run over there telling them something and didn't didn't
dirty end of the stick so so now they
had a problem they had to face because everybody in the world of peoples of color and even many of the white people
in Europe of the Jews and so forth having inherited that knowledge from the Iberian who was their celebrated the
winter solstice the time when the earth tilts back towards the Sun and we're
moving back towards summertime now and it was on December the 24th grounds
in seven the 22nd and went on through some places December the 25th and it was
the birthday of harus o-haru from which we get the word Giro the son of all set and I saw name is Nam
at Isis and Osiris the birthday of time moves and birthday admit that just about any savior God around the world was born
on this day so they say these people not gonna let this go so we're gonna have to have a birthday for hours they came up
with the 6th of January 16th of April several days in April in August some
days in September and they finally decided on December the 25th when did they decide it 325 years after the fact
when everybody that knew Jesus was going away from here anybody who had so may
have I had some birth records didn't have any moment and how did they get
people to accept it not to ceptin loose domine on holy God
holy Jesus Mary Mother of God by the power of the sword Constantine the
greater the Council of Nicaea in 325 most everything you believe about Christianity was decided then and there
was the cross and the sword they didn't do it my friend because the African
Bishop said this is not true what you say Jesus is not one with God he was a
great prophet this day you either accept it or we run your behind out of answer they ran him out and they established it
by the sword there on I think I've dealt
with that I'm not gonna deal with Santa Claus now tonight [Music]
okay
don't worry about my training I stay over if I don't get this is often just
be in Africa like this oh Santa Claus or
Sinterklaas as the Duchess calling it's
another name for Satan how do I know that all yet do it look at the letters
that's one little bit you see the end but also know that whom this is supposed
to be narrated to was one st. Nicholas who was supposed to be a Bishop of Myra
in the 4th century of this era of the Common Era and he became the patron
saint of thieves pawnbrokers children
active children in there two thieves and pawn brokers because thievery was all
right in your Bazaar organized they had guilds of thieves in Europe
[Music] no way you get locked up in Judah Minaj didn't kill he was out there working on
your owners independent that's when they liked your wine up but if you were
protected by the guild you could make it and and st. Nicholas was the patron
saint of that group and Pyro's and he
was also called Old Nick which you not have take might you go back and study
European language was another word for the devil because in there was always
with the European and ambiguous aspect in anything they dealt with and they had
to devil or God or whatever they were all and that's why in the mistranslation in the King James Version of the Bible
you will find all of these contradictions
how can a divine I'm using their term I don't even like the term God because his
dog spelled backwards but I'm just using it for convenience now and there's a whole historical reason as to why I
can't go into that right now how can a good loving God Father
Africans always say mother father God but you can't procreate nothing even on the spiritual level without the female
and male aspect only Europeans God s time even in divine creative
intelligence and universe got to hook up in the midnight hour make things happen it's a holy thing when you go about it
right but how can this good loving father as they called him they could do
no wrong created the world and said it is good that is perfect they created all things
perfect do all that and then have a devil in network now if God created
everything according to their thinking how in the deuce did the devil there and all the creation was done by
God where did the devil come from you
can ask that question it was already there how could it be there if God was
greater than it I'm asking some questions and you know I'm asking this
question not to pick with you or not to attack your belief system because I
don't mess with me back belief system will deal with history whether it agree with it or not a lot of young people are
asking these questions and we're giving them all kind of fantastic and mythological answers that do not make
sense to them and so they are seeking answers in the wrong place and therefore
if God and the Bible often says that God caused this evil to happen to this
person cause that evil happen to that person how can you be good and cause evil at the same time what you're looking at is
a mistranslation of the ancient text in the King James Version there that's what you're looking at a confusion there so
with the European and I did that to demonstrate that those who missed translated the text always had that idea
it was really no difference between them between God and the devil it all worked in them together their good and evil is
whoever could sustain it by the sword that made it holy and righteous and just
there could be nothing no more evil than human enslavement nothing more evil than that nothing more evil than genocide but
as long as you can do it and get away with it then you are ordained by God to do it because God let you get away with
it that's the Europeans thinking his way of thinking so this is how now Santa Claus becomes Satan that used to ride
around on a great donkey they have a thing about that dunkey man
on Christmas Eve night when everybody was scared to death because they said
that night to the goblins and ghosts and things came out and messing with him and he had this big way so bowl filled with
this intoxicating beverage that he would feed the goblins and keep them from messing with the people and that's how
he became father Christmas also another word for him is Kris Kringle Kris
Kringle means the birth of the Christ child now this I got to ask you that way man so let's be logical let's put aside
belief and all that let's be logical in our thinking how can a little short
dumpy fat red suit red white suit man
puffy face white man be a representative
of a one and the same of the Christ child born over in a hot land in
Palestine a black boy in a manger in a state who eventually was assassinated
for rebelling against the Roman government where's a connection but
here's the foolishness of it I don't mean to sound arrogant or anything but
it just sounds foolish to me look these young people are coming to me with this and with them to us with this now either you gonna deal with reality with them or
you wanna lose them all together but these fantasies are not gonna keep it they made it work for you and your time because you didn't know any better God
winked on your ignorance because you didn't know no better but now the door has been opened the life is here
and if you fight against that you fight against yourself you prick against yourself in fighting
against it we now have not trying to convert you to anything I'm not trying to get you to join anything but yourself I want you to do your own thinking and
you can't do your own thinking unless you know this as well as that then you
got some information you can work with in your brain computer other than that you'll be walking around supporting
their system and keeping them caught from now that's why god I'll have to kill you with them too good you won't
let go
so he gonna get him he and she go get him you no doubt about that in my mind I
might not be allowed to see but they don't get got the law of karma is an immutable law what goes around comes
around never fail all you got to do is study history and you will see that now
here's the thing that shows the insanity that we have come into since we've been captivated here you were high to get
money and you got to do it you're
compelled to do it there's a sin against God if you don't do it you offend the baby Jesus if you don't
do it get this lemon I got to get his
bite man is my lad and he puts you in a
state of panic and hysteria there's only 20 days left to Christmas only 15 days
and he come at you do your babies cuz you know black folks don't like to
deny that babies nothing it's hard to say no to your babies and they do think they lacking so much in
the world a day anyway so you figure at least I can give him this little bit of science I know what you're thinking man
let me ask you something know how in the
name of heaven do you do all this you got to work hard two to three extra jobs
Valentine's is amazing stop spending
money you ain't got wait till the babies
go to sleep at night and here you go with your fools off
[Music]
[Applause] but you don't hit somewhere they wake up
the next morning their eyes all bright and looking and stuff around a tree come here baby look what Santa Klaus
then done for you now you can do what
you want in the wind well I'm gonna work my butt off buy some for my children it
sounds so white for him today
but here's a part of the mental genocide of that you lied to your child for 10-12
years you may think that's a light thing but it isn't you have your child
believing in something and I mean we believe in it I was hurt I cried for two
days when they told me when no Santa Claus I'm crying man and I'm trying to figure
out how can my mama who's a beautiful woman who loved me and worked hard right now what whites working the white folks
how watch me clothes and ironing clothes brother they floating that take care of me how could she lie to me like that and
it establishes if the child is not conscious it establishes subconsciously
a distrust of time is running out it
establishes a distrust and anything else you say so now by the time they get to adolescence you wonder why they don't
trust what you say too much you're lied to him like it for what to give white folks to create I'm gonna
close out on this and because I got to I got to say just a little bit about the fourth of July here but I got to say
this too can I just a minute [Music]
many times I go to the prison I didn't know I had such you know brothers had
books all around in prison I went down one Hall of one prison it was like I was returning the kapre from victory all
over there man oh are the brothers in prison be reading the books and I went to one prison man heard all these
cheering all away so I get to go and talk to brother the prisoner lines so
I'm in the prison talking brother and a lot of my fine got armed robbery charges
and many of those charges fell during the season of the year so I asked him I
said brother what's responsible for that where do you do that there's motionless crimes are committed against the other
black people so why'd you do that brother he said well now look I'm gonna
tell you this is what some of the brothers told me they said when you when your children keep saying that this is
Christmas and this new thing coming out and that thing coming out and your woman keep putting pressure on you about you
got to get some money and get some Christmas in here because I know I can identify with that that's why I would talk with this attire with man laughing
matter sister I've been through that I let some sister go behind
and that's four I found out the truth about
good their pressure on me and I had to get this money I couldn't get no job I didn't had no job so I had to go get in
the best way I can cuz when I walked me for my children my woman I want to look like a man now you know that's his
manhood huh into what he can get you materially from this white man look at
that and in counseling with some of the
sisters they're the wise and their open think of these men in there that's it wouldn't it be better for you to have
your man home for your children would that be a better Christmas for you didn't this man to be in jail behind
these material things on baller-ass and you know how it goes halfway through the day most of the stuff is torn I'm laying
in the corner you looking at it and
realize you've been living in a fool's paradise so to get over there you break out the bottle and have Christmas cheer
and then once you get that alcohol in you and stop thinking back to to spend money you don't have thinking about how
you gonna get your rent paid next model your mortgage pay I'll feed your babies in January then you resort to the ritual
of busting each other up Saturday I don't know about you but when I was
coming up I couldn't figure out why on such a beautiful day when I had all
these toys and it was so lovely said it closes Jesus never at all and everybody
was so happy that a fight always broke out for the day was over
no no
fourthly you lied I'm finished yes take me a minute on this I don't want to take
advantage because I know you got other things to do but both of you lie why do
I refer to it as 1/4 of you like white folks came to me and said black man if
you help me win my freedom from the tyranny of King George I will give you
your freedom because every one of those dogs that wrote we hold these 12 these
Jews to be self-evident that all men are created equal while either slaveholders
or had made their fortune off of the slave trade and somewhere imagine all 54
of those dirt farmers that met at the First and Second Continental powers and
Jews among Thomas Jefferson George Washington I don't know where the city
of Washington is I know where Banneker city is I live near balance of City I don't want no damn Washington here I
wouldn't name anything after him I don't even like mentioning his name he died as
a result of judging the money in the slaves and quarters after raping a black woman
and that's recorded by white historian Arnold Toynbee he had over 350 some
slaves so once they traded him for hogs here a room father whose country
certainly not mine and to make my children look up to this dog
his mental genocide [Applause]
Thomas Jefferson the great architect of freedom who wasn't misguided entertainer
sang you know one who's who wrote the document and signed the document that freed all man it did not free all men it
only freed the rich landed gentry in the thirteen colonies it didn't even free
the common man in the thirteen colonies and I damn sure didn't free us he had slaves and he had this penchant
for messin with adolescent girls impregnating them and when he had two
black babies from those girls from those slave girl he would take them at six seven eight nine ten years old and work
them in his nail factory I'm supposed to honor that the shot that was heard
around the world I'll be finished in a minute the shot that was heard around
the world was not fired at Lexington and it wasn't even heard around a westerlyn
give a damn about it excuse me for cousins only that bullet
landed in the chests of Crispus Attucks which I am NOT proud of because he was a
jump a misguided chump why do you say
that brother why you'd be so cold he just come off the plantation himself and
now he won't stand and fight for the same owner if you got to catch a bullet for something kept it for them brothers
and sisters back there more than their freedom [Applause]
and they repaid him by celebrating his birthday until they came up with the
July 4th thing on March the 5th they call it Christmas annex day and they made a statue to him with a white woman
standing over top of a aint eagle spreaded wings just add his name him put his picture on it that's how much they
thought about him but one of the British generals came here because he what had
happened is the British started recruiting the black slaves and we're gonna put a gun in your hand okay we're
gonna put a gun in your hand and we're gonna let you shoot at white folks blood
started joining the British Army by hundreds and thousands and so George
Washington who didn't want black folks in their army at first I said we don't arm the blacks we're not gonna win this war and one of the generals that came
over here said we're not at war with the 13 colonies we have war with Ethiopia there were so many black folks there in
that war now after we won the war for them they plunged us deeper in slavery
than ever we had been I'm gonna read this closing statement I'm really finished now on the 4th of you like I'm
gonna call on brother Frederick Douglass now who said it's so well I don't white
folks can really be arrogant they call this man an ex-slave
fighting for the abolition of other slaves to come in the year 1852 and give
a speech on his love for America on their 76th anniversary of America's
independence and old Fred came yes he did and this is what Fred saying what to
the American slave is your 4th of July our answer a day that reveals to him
more than all other days of the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he
is the constant victim to him your celebration a sham your boasted liberty and unholy
license your national greatness swelling vanity your sounds of rejoicing on empty
and heartless your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence your
shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery your prayers and hymns your sermons and thanksgiving with all your
religious parades and solemnity are to him mere bomb baths deceptions and pious
hypocrisy a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages
there is not a nation on the earth guilty of practice is more shocking and
bloody than other people of the United States at this very hour go where you may search where you will roam through
all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world travel through South America
search out every abuse and when you have found the last lay your facts side by
side of the everyday practices of this nation and you will say with me that for
revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy America reigns without a rival
brothers and sisters that is what the fourth of you lack and any other
European holiday means to me so when you and when you are celebrating make sure
you are celebrating that which has brought life to you which has enhanced your life which has advanced your life
which is a part of your great
