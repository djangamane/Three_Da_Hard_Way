the isis papers chapter one the crest theory of color confrontation and racism white supremacy
a psychogenic theory and world outlook unlike religion the body of knowledge
known as science takes the position that all observable phenomena can be explained or at least is grist for the
middle of investigation analysis and understanding by the human mind in today's very small world at least
three-quarters of the people are non-white and the members of this non-white majority population are subjected to domination
through their lives either directly or indirectly by a tiny minority of the world's people who classified themselves
as white racism white supremacy then is revealed as one of if not the most
important observable phenomenon in the world today for which social behavior and all other scientists should be
seeking an explanation heretofore racism has been defined and described variously
see gelati corner butts and pinderhughes yet in my view the comment made by oliver c
cox in his 1959 award-winning text cast class and race still prevails
it does not ordinarily realize that of all the great massive writings on race relations
there is available no consistent theory of race relations the need for such a sociological
explanation is so great that recently when one author succeeded with some degree of superficial logic
in explaining the phenomenon in terms of caste relations the college textbooks and social science
journals almost unanimously and unquestioningly hurriedly adopted his theory
perhaps social and behavioral scientists have failed to develop a sound and consistent theory of racism because of
their tendency to be less demanding and less stringently disciplined in sticking to observable and measurable data then the so-called
physical scientists are required to be in formulating hypotheses frequently contrary to all the basic
premises of modern science statements are made by some of these scientists at priority
that is to say claimed as valid independent of observation similarly society in general fails to
impose a significant amount of pressure on behavioral and social scientists to yield viable theories and
definitions such theories and definitions subsequently can stand and function as efficient and effective tools to be
utilized by social engineers as guides for changing social reality
however the contrary seems to be the case if there is any pressure at all this maintain a social
status quo and all too often institutions of the society reward the superficial inconsistent and dysfunctional theories
of societal dynamics neely fuller in his 1969 copyrighted
the united independent compensatory code system concept a textbook workbook for thought speech
and or action for victims of racism white supremacy recognize the need for a functional
statement on racism when it could be utilized daily by those earnestly seeking to bring about social
change fuller observed that contrary to most present thinking there is only one functioning racism in
a known world that's white supremacy he challenges his readers to identify and then to
demonstrate the superiority or functional supremacy of any of the world's non-white peoples over anyone including that since there
is no operational supremacy of any colored people fuller reveals that the only valid operational definition
of racism is white supremacy he observes that in spite of any and all statements the world's non-white
peoples may make them make about themselves having economic or political independence and the like in
the final analysis they are all victims of the white supremacy process he places major emphasis on the present
realities of the world that can be verified and tested rather than on what one could imagine to be the case such as
a black or yellow supremacy he further emphasizes that instead of focusing on individual
cases on specific locations a perspective that examines the patterns of relationships
between whites and non-whites worldwide must be developed fuller explains that
racism is not merely a pattern of individual and or institutional practice it is a universally operating system of
white supremacy and domination in which the majority of the world's whites participate
he discounts the validity of theories and they recognize the evolution of economic systems as the origin of this
state of affairs instead he reveals the inadequate analysis of such theories by suggesting
the various economic systems such as capitalism communism and socialism have been devised
used and refined in the efforts to achieve the primary goal of white domination in
other words the goal of the white supremacy system is none other than the establishment
maintenance expansion and refinement of world domination by members of a group that classifies itself as the
white race fuller then suggests that the word race in this sense has
little biological validity but is translated more correctly as organization the sole purpose of which
is to maintain white domination and world control fuller's emphasis on the concept of
color amplifies the assertion made in 1903 by w.b du bois perhaps the greatest american social scientist
in the souls of black folk that the great problem facing the 20th century is that of the color line whether or not
one is emotionally comfortable with fuller's thesis and assessment is not germane the question of such
comfort never has been the importance important concern of scientific investigation
of great significance in fuller's work is a description of relationships between non-white and white peoples fuller defines the
and elucidates these relationships as a means of accounting for an illuminating many past and
present observable social practices also this examination reveals that despite all kinds of
programs and pronouncements to the contrary for the past several hundred years white supremacist social conditions have
remained intact as a dominant social reality impressed that the concept of a system of
white domination over the world's non-white people could explain the seeming predicament and dilemma of non-white
social reality i tended to focus as a psychiatrist on what possible motivational force operative at
both the individual and group levels could account for the evolution of these patterns of social
behavior practice that apparently function in all areas of human activity economics education entertainment labor
law politics religion sex and war while fuller clearly suggested this
system consists of patterns of thought speech and action practice the various degrees by the majority of the world's white people
the only comment on ideology he makes is that most whites most white people hate
black people the reason that most white people hate black people is because whites are not black people if you know this
about white people you need no little else if you do not know this about white people virtually all else that you know about
them will only confuse you to make fuller's account a step further
it should be noted that in the majority of instances any neurotic drive for superiority usually is founded upon a
deep and pervading sense of inadequacy and inferiority it is not true that white people
represent numerical terms a very small minority of the world people and more profoundly is it not white
itself the very absence of any ability to produce color i reason then that the quality of
whiteness is indeed a genetic inadequacy or relative genetic deficiency stay
based upon the genetic inability to produce the skin pigments of melanin which is responsible for all skin color
the vast majority of the world's people are not so afflicted which suggests that color is normal for
human beings and color absence is abnormal additionally the state of color absence acts always as a genetic
recessive to the dominant genetic factor of color production color always annihilates phenotypically
and genetically speaking the non-color white black people possess the greatest
color potential with brown red and yellow peoples possessing lesser qualities respectively this is
the genetic and psychological basis for the crest theory of color confrontation and racism white supremacy
the color confrontation theory states that the white or color deficient europeans responded psychologically with a profound sense of
numerical inadequacy and color inferiority in their confrontations with the majority of the world's peoples
all of whom possess varying degrees of color production color producing capacity the
psychological response whether conscious or unconscious revealed an inadequacy based on most obvious and
fundamental part of the being their external appearance as might be anticipated in terms of modern
psychological theories whites defensively developed an uncontrollable sense of hostility and
aggression this attitude has continued to manifest itself throughout the history of mass confrontations between whites and people
of color that the initial hostility and aggression came only from whites as
recorded in innumerable diaries journals and books written by whites also records indicate that
only after long periods of great abuse have non-whites responded defensively with any form of
counter-attack this perplexing psychological reaction of whites has been directed towards all peoples with
the capacity to produce melanin however the most profound aggression have been directed towards black people who have
the greatest color potential and therefore the most envied and feared in genetic color competition
the experience of numerical inadequacy and genetic color inferiority led whites to implement a
number of interesting although devastating to non-white people psychological
defense mechanisms the initial psychological defense maneuver was the repression
of the initial painful awareness of inadequacy this primary ego defense was reinforced by a host of other
defense mechanisms one of the most important of those defense mechanisms was reaction
formation a response that converts at the psychological level something desired and envied but
wholly unattainable into something discredited and despised white's desiring to have skin color but
unable to attain it claimed consciously or unconsciously that skin color was disgusting to them and
began attributing negative qualities to color especially to blackness interesting the term non-white is a
double negative resulting in a positive statement this is perhaps a freudian slip wherein the use of language ultimately
reveals the primary psychological dynamic white's desire to have colored skin can be observed at the very
first signs of spring or summer when they began to strip off their clothes as many pieces as the law will allow often permitting
their skins to be burned severely in an attempt to add some color to the pale bodies
and rendering themselves vulnerable to skin cancer in the process most cosmetics are also an attempt to
add color to white skin such coloring makeup is provided for the white male as well as female
and finally untold moons are spent annually on chemicals that are advertised as being able to
increase the tanning potential of whites the fact that some blacks have attempted to change the color of their skin to
white does not mitigate the force of this argument as it can be demonstrated readily that these non-whites are
responding to the already established social conditions of white supremacy such a process as
seen in blacks and other non-whites may be described as identification with the oppressor
another example of the reaction formation difference is the elaboration of the myth of white genetic superiority which
continues to be reinforced assiduously note jensen's latest elaborations and their acceptance at all levels of white
social structure acutely aware of the inferior inferior genetic ability to produce skin color
whites built the elaborate myth of white genetic superiority furthermore white set about the huge
task of evolving a social political and economic structure that would support the myth of the inferiority of blacks
and other non-whites in additional psychological defense maneuver utilized by whites has been
that of projection feeling extremely hostile extreme hostility and hate towards
non-whites whites began the pattern of stating that non-whites hated them in many instances
this mechanism has served to mitigate the guilt whites occasionally experience for the impulse to
aggress against blacks and other people of color another perhaps special instance of the
use of projection is the historic and continuing desire of whites for sexual alliances with non-whites a desire indulged by
white males throughout the world this deep desire has been projected into black males and females and
is manifest in a notion that people of color have sexual desires for white males and females
the color confrontation theory postulates that whites desired and still do desire sexual alliances with
non-whites both male and female because it is only through this route that whites can achieve the illusion of being able to
produce color the extreme rage vented against the idea of sexual alliance between a black male
and a white female which has long been a dominant theme in the white supremacy culture is viewed by the color confrontation
theory as a result of the white male's intense fear of the black male's capacity to fulfill the greatest longing of the
white female that are conceiving and birthing a product of color
there are other sexual behaviors practiced by some whites that can be illuminated by the color confrontation thesis
for example in this autobiography malcolm x stated that the sexual perversion he was asked to perform most often by white men was
for him as a black male to have sexual intercourse with white females in their presence
while they white men looked on this behavioral pattern on the part of white males instead of being dismissed
as a perversion can be understood when viewed as white males fantasize identification with black male's
capacity to give conceptual products of color to white females something white females desperately
desire but white males cannot fulfill further vivid testimony is given by
black males who have engaged in sexual intercourse with white females these men report that a frequent
utterance of white females is that they wish to have black babies the color confrontation
theory also explains why black males testicles were the body parts that white males attacked in most lynchings
the tesco store powerful color producing genetic material likewise the repeated and consistent focus on the
size of the black male's penises by both white females white males and females is viewed by this theory as a
displacement of the fundamental concern with the genetic color producing capacity residing in the testicles since the fact
of color envy must remain repressed color desire can never be mentioned or the
entire white psychological structure collapses therefore attention is placed to a less
threatening object or symbol the penis finally the degradation of sex
and the white supremacy culture allows for yet another area of insight into the fundamental psychological dynamics of whites and
their self-alienation regarding their physical appearance at the most primordial level sex can be
viewed as the reproduction of one's own image or of self and of kind
according to the color confrontation theory white supremacy culture degrades the act of sex and the process
of self-reproduction because for whites both are reflective of whiteness and in turn their inability to produce color
this self-deficiency clearly is despised and is stated most explicitly in the religious and
moral philosophies of the white supremacy culture yet this manner of degrading the sexual
act is not found in non-white cultures in fact the very opposite is the case
the act of reproduction is held in the highest esteem as reflected in non-white arts and religion religious practices the
artistic and religious practices of india in africa give strong and continuous testimony to this fact
and whites the initial core feeling of alienation from themselves from and from the act that produced the image
found subsequent expressions in their thought process religious philosophies
moral code social acts and the entire social structure psychiatrists and other behavioral
scientists frequently use the patterns of overt behavior toward others as indications of what is felt
fundamentally about the self if hate and lack of respect are manifested
towards others hate and lack of respect are felt most often at deeper levels towards
themselves facets of the behavioral patterns within the white supremacy culture framework
support this thesis for example many white writers in all areas of the world experience
and write about their profound sense of self-alienation additionally some of the current political social and behavioral activity
enacted by whites against the ideology and values of the white social structure although not spoken of in the
terminology used here can be appreciated at one level as an expression of the same kernel
of alienation against whites thus to hippies and nippies by allowing dirt to accumulate on
themselves in one sense or and adding color to their skin they also by
allowing their head and facial hair to proliferate cover themselves from the only
part of their bodies that was substantive color their hair the present frantic attempts made by
whites to counter this sense of alienation took form a form of free open sexual practices and
sexual orgies such attempts will be unsuccessful because again the core problem is a sense of
alienation primarily from their own colorlessness and secondarily from the social practices
structures whites have built around that psychological core over the centuries racism
white supremacy having begun as a form of self-alienation has evolved into the most highly
refined form of alienation from others as well the color confrontation theory views all of the present battlegrounds in the
world as vivid reflections of this reality the destructive and aggressive behavior
patterns being displayed by white peoples towards all non-white peoples is evidence of the inner hate
hostility and rejection they feel toward themselves and of the depth of eight self-alienation that has evolved from a
genetic and psychological kernel of color inadequacy the mass and ability of whites to live
and attend school in the presence of non-whites is expressed in the patterns of blacks and white housing and education
throughout the country and the world in terms of the color confrontation thesis this inability is seen as the
apparent and psychological discomfort experienced by whites in situations where in confronting their
neighbors of color they must face their color inadequacy daily also the myth of white superiority is
exploded in the presence of equitable social and economic opportunity the white personality
in the presence of color can be stabilized only by keeping blacks and other non-whites in obvious inferior positions the situation of mass
proximity to blacks is intolerable to whites because blacks are inherently more than equal
people of color always will have something highly visible than whites never can have or produce the genetic
factor of color always in a presence of color whites will feel genetically inferior
difficulty whites have in according non-white socio-political and economic equality with the white supremacy
structure stems neither from a moral issue nor from the political or economic need but from the
fundamental sense of their own unequal condition in regards to their numeric numerical inadequacy and color
deficiency they can compensate for the color and adequacy only by placing themselves
in socially superior positions the color inadequacy of whiteness necessitates a social structure
based on white superiority only tokenism can be tolerated by such a motivational psychological state
wherein the evolution of the myth of the exceptional non-white is used
against again as a defense mechanism the thrust towards superiority over peoples of
color to drive towards material accumulation the drive towards the technological culture and the drive towards power are all
cornerstones of the universal white supremacy culture and they are viewed in terms of the color confrontation thesis as responses to the core
psychological sense of inadequacy this inadequacy is not measured in terms of infant size as
compared with that of the adult as postulated by alfred adler rather it is the inadequacy rooted in
the inability to produce melanin this genetic state is in actuality of variant of albinism
the color confrontation theory further postulates that whites are vulnerable to the sense of numerical inadequacy this inadequacy is
apparently apparent in their drive to divide the vast majority of non-whites into
fractional as well as frictional minorities this is viewed as a fundamental behavior
response of whites to their own minority status the white race is structured and manipulated their own
thought process and conceptual patterns as well as those of the entire non-white world majority
so that the real numerical minority whites illusionally feel and represent itself in the world's
majority while the true numerical majority non-whites illusionally feel and view
itself as the minority interestingly the white collective whenever discussing
a question of color never discusses any of its own particular ethnic groups as minorities
but constantly focuses on the various ethnic language and religious groups of non-white peoples as
minorities then great efforts are made to initiate conflict between these arbitrary groups
this is one of the key methods by which a minority can retain can remain in power to divide frictionalize and conquer
pattern observable through history wherever non-whites are confronted by whites
results primarily from white sense of color deficiency and secondarily from their sense of numerical inadequacy
this pattern then is a compensatory adjustment to permits to permit psychological comfort through
dominance and control similarly the present day frantic
focus on birth control for the entire non-white world is another example of white people's conscious or unconscious awareness of
the numerical deficiency status there is neither great emphasis
on controlling the birth of whites in fact there are some white
governmental groups that give dividends to citizens for increased procreation the above are but a few examples
selected from millions of large and small behavior patterns practiced by whites and bearing varying quantities
yet these examples effectively demonstrate the individual and collective neurotic need to focus on color sex genetics
numbers superiority inferiority white supremacy and power the color confrontation theory contends
that all of the above can be explained on the basis of the core psychological sense of color deficiency and numerical
inadequacy individual patterns of behavior that over time evolved into collective
social institutional and now systemic patterns are seen as the origin of the system of white supremacy which
operates at a universal level and is the only effective and functional racism existence
in the world today further racism white supremacy and this historic e-pokes
viewed as a full-blown social contradiction and a major social dynamic superseding all others is an influencing
universal social practices and decisions the color confrontation theory recognizes racism
as one of the dominating forces determining character development personality and formation type therefore
a functional definition of racism white supremacy is the behavioral syndrome of an individual and
collective color inferiority and numerical inadequacy that includes patterns of thought speech
and action as seen in members of the white organization when then are the practical implications
of what are the practical implications of this theory of major importance is the fact that for the
first time in centuries non-white peoples throughout the world will have a rational basis for understanding the motivational nuances of individual and
collective white behavior the color confrontation thesis theorizes the majority of the world's
people non-whites were manipulated into subordinate positions because never having experienced such a state in
terms of their own thought and logic processes and premises they were unprepared to understand
patterns of behavior predicated upon a sense of color deficiency and numerical inadequacy
this is analogous to the man with the two eyes finding it difficult if not impossible to understand the behavior
patterns of motivation of the congen congeniality of one-eyed man
who always looked upon a two-eyed state with jealous antagonism and perhaps aggression armed
with such insight knowledge and understanding non-whites will cease to be vulnerable to the behavioral maneuverings of
individuals of collective whites but non-whites will be less vulnerable to the messages of white superiority and
that radiate through the known universe and permeate white world cultures which are dominated by
the white supremacy system the understanding will have profound effects on develop being egos and
self-images of all non-white children who suffer severe damage under the white supremacy culture
moreover wherever they are confronted by the ideology of white superiority supremacy
non-whites will understand it is only a compensatory psychological adjustment
for a genetic numerical deficiency state thus the white supremacy message can be evaluated and negated more readily
this allows non-whites to gain psychological liberation from the white ideology domination that
negatively affects the total functioning of non-whites further non-whites will be less vulnerable for
being maneuvered into conflict with one another thus weakened weakening the continued domination of the white supremacy system
also white peoples of the world presumably also could benefit from such an awareness of the motivation behind behaviors that often baffle them
if they are sincere in their attempts to stop the practices of white supremacy racism whites may be able to find methods to do
so once the cause is understood perhaps some psychiatrists will develop a method of mass psychotherapy
to help whites be come comfortable with their color and their numbers however one can
foresee a major problem arising from the possible difficulty of motivating whites to release the secondary gains
historically derived from the racist system the possibility of white's people accepting this analysis of the white
problems in human relations is not for me to answer i do not know that the majority of the world's people are looking for an answer
to the dilemma that was once called the american dilemma they're looking for a change
perhaps the crest theory of color confrontation will help them to make that change in any event i'm
reminded of a statement made by freud's biogra biographer ernst jones and the analysis
and justification of every scientific generalization is that it enables us to comprehend
something that is otherwise obscure and as james b con conan has stated the test of the new
idea is not only its success in correlating the then known factors but much more in his
success or failure and stimulating further experimentation or observation which in turn is fruitful this dynamic
aspect of science viewed not as practical undertaking but as development and conceptual schemes seems
to me to be close to the heart of the best definition of science
this essay analyzes the unique universal behavior phenomenon of white supremacy racism and
places it in the conceptual framework and contextual context of a theoretical formulation the
fundamentals of the dynamics inherent in the spectrum of relations cover all areas of life activity between people
who classify themselves as white and those people whom whites have classified as
non-whites the isis papers chapter 2 the origin of alienation anxiety and narcissism
Chapter 2 - PAGES 17-38
dedication this essay is dedicated to genevieve akate a nigerian journalist who because
of the profound pain of alien nation took her life on june 25 1978 while residing in the united states
of america the world lost a brilliant mind and a generous person shortly before her death she stated my
superstructure is solid i need a formidable foundation this essay is my contribution to our
understanding of the destructive dynamic of alienation psychiatry as a discipline is
floundering on its previously established conceptual and theoretical foundation imported from 19th century europe
my continuing question to myself as a late 20th century precautionary in general and child psychiatry practicing
in the power capital of the world washington dc is can a greater understanding be achieved in the study of human behavior
as it is organized and manifested in the world's dominant power system culture my answer is affirmative we can derive
an ever increasing level of order out of the existing chaos a diagnostic and statistical
manual that gets heavier and wordier with each effort thereby we can enhance our diagnostic
and treatment skills and increase the possibility of prevention allowing us to serve a suffering
humanity better in how astronomers found god robert jastrow states
there's a kind of religion in science it is the religion of a person who believes there is order and harmony in
the universe and every event can be explained in a rational way as a product of some
previous event every effort must have its cause jastrow continues taking a quotation from albert einstein the
scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation as a social and behavioral scientist i'm
convinced it is possible to understand in depth the patterns and systems of behavior encountered in
the individual and in a broad collective my further conviction is that we can serve humankind maximally as behavioral
scientists and physicians only when we adequately analyze the fundamental causation and
logic of these patterns of behavior three major focus of attention in
western social and behavioral science particularly in psychiatry alienation anxiety
and narcissism are not unrelated isolated syndrome abstractions as they have been discussed
by western social and behavioral scientists these separately described phenomena are
not only interrelated but they have a common origin and cause there are derivatives of the same casual
dynamic although that casual dynamic has remained unidentified the source of these three phenomenon in
the origin of western civilization itself alienation and the color confrontation
theory i stated that racism white supremacy having begun as a form of alienation towards the self now has evolved into the most
highly refined form of alienation towards others as well the color confrontation theory views all
of the present battlegrounds in the world today as vivid reflections of this alien nation towards others
the destructive and aggressive behavior patterns displayed throughout the world by white peoples toward all non-white peoples as the
evidence of an inner hate hostility and rejection they feel towards themselves and of the deep self-alienation that has
evolved from their genetic inadequacy my extended definition of alienation centers around the recognition that it
is a fundamental behavioral dynamic in western civilization and culture alienation is a powerful centrifugal
genetic psychological and societal dynamic that over time drives human beings further and further
away from all effective meaningful emotional supportive and truthful communications amongst each other
the alien nation dynamic increasingly forces people away from one another as western civilization and culture evolves
as seen through each successive generation since its origin including greek civilization and the
roman empire alienation is the very same dynamic that pushes human beings away from respectful
and harmonious relationships with the physical environment leading to the pollution and destruction of the planet
most important the alienation dynamic forces the individual away from all manifestations of self-understanding
and self-respect including the most fundamental respect the respect for one's genetic makeup
the encyclopedia britannica records that the roots of the idea of alienation are found in the works of plutonius a
roman philosopher born in egypt who lived up between 205 and 270 a.d
as well as in the theology of both saint augustine and martin luther the latter addressed the struggle to
alienate oneself from one's own imperfections by identification with a transcendental
perfect being entries on alienation did not appear in major reference books of the social
sciences until 1935 but the concept of alienation was present in classical sociological texts
of the 19th and early 20th centuries in the works of marx durkheim tony's weber and simmel
eric and married joffin josephson and the man alone alien nation in modern society had the
following to say about alienation indeed ever since the great technological and political revolutions
of the late 18th century with the shattering impact on a rigid social order and a promise of individual
freedom one of the most disturbing phenomena in western culture has been man's sense of estrangement from the
world he himself has made or inherited in a word man's alienation from himself
and from others this theme of alienation of modern man runs through the literature and
drama of two continents it can be traced in a continent as well as the form of modern art it preoccupies theologians and
philosophers and to many psycho psychologists and sociologists is the central problem of our time
in various ways they tell us that ties have snapped that formerly bound western man to himself and to the world about
him in diverse language they say that man in modern industrial societies is rapidly becoming detached from nature
from his old gods from the technology that has transformed his environment and now threatens to destroy it
from his work and its products and from his leisure from the complex social institutions and
presumably serve but are more likely to manipulate him from the community in which he lives and
above all from himself from his body of in his sex from his feelings of love and tenderness and from
his art his creative and productive potential contemporary contributors to the
definition of alienation include such thinkers as psychoanalyst eric fromm
philosophers lewis mumford and herbert marcuse existentialists john paul sartay albert
camus paul tillett and martin buber and sociologists david reisman
robert k merton and talcott parsons in summary there are at least five
casual theories concerning alien nation the economic the technological the sociological and the
existential and a psychological karl marx is identified with the economic theory
marx viewed alienation as a result of the private ownership of the means of production
and expropriation of a man's labor by the capitalists resulting in worker exploitation and
class struggle money and commodities becoming the most meaningful things in man's existence and thus man's alienation from man
technological theories attribute alienation demands adjusted lifestyle to machines and
automation sociological theories view the decline of the limited local community an emergence of mass
society and a simultaneous increasing sense of individual powerlessness as the cause of alienation philosophic
existential theories emphasize that alienation is inherent in definite finite and isolated character of man's
existence as a stranger and an alien in the world psychological theories are dominated by the views of sigmund freud
who viewed alienation or self-estrangement as a resultant of the split between the unconscious and the conscious forces in the personality
the individual thus being out of touch in the sense that repressed and unacknowledged desires
motivate his behavior more specifically freud pinpointed the edible conflict and the frustrations
inherent in civilized society as expressing his civilization and his discontents as a source of alienation
the following are but a few items from a long list of suggested manifestations of alienation
child abuse psychosis suicide neurotic depression delinquency
psychosomatic disorders prejudice civil riots wild cat strikes in the rise
of fascism all are believed to have derived from one or more of the following states
social isolation self-estrangement a sense of powerlessness meaninglessness normalnessness and
cultural estrangement whereas i agree with the existence of an alien alienation dynamic in western
civilization culture i disagree with all of the aforementioned theories of its causation
these theories remain superficial in their analysis as each fails to reach the core of the origin of western
civilization the multiplicity of theories on such a basic and pervasive dynamic as alienation reflects the failure to
comprehend the origin and nature of western man who has created at conscious and unconscious levels the
totality of the western cultural imperative but the sufficiency
in a sufficiently deep investigation the myriad aspects of the alienation dynamic that
on the surface appear unconnected or recognized as highly interrelated and tied to a central core a unitary
causation anxiety and narcissism are tied to that same fundamental core as illustrated in the following diagram the
three-dimensional cone-shaped figure represents the multiple levels at which reality phenomenon may be decoded the dots on
the surface at level 5 represent a seemingly isolated multiple phenomenon that can be examined at every increasing level of
depth indicated by levels four through one the basic interconnections between isolated
phenomena are less apparent at level five than at level two or level one and interconnections however
become increasingly clear as the greater depth of phenomenon penetration is achieved
the term western means white western has become a comfortable and for
some confusing obfuscation at euphemism or code for the word white the terms western civilization and
western culture specifically refer to the civilization and culture evolved determined directed developed and controlled by
people who classify themselves as white as mentioned in the color confrontation theory white skinned people who lack any
substantial level of permanent melanin in their skin historically have contrasted themselves with all people in
the world who have substantial recognizable and permanent levels of melanin
these skin pigmented persons are referred to by white people to whites as non-white people or when
they are subdivided by the whites they referred to as black brown red and yellow people
non-white people collectively constitute the global numerical majority the skin pigmented global majority is
genetically dominant to the genetically recessive whites and genetically they can annihilate the
whites these facts are essential to a thorough understanding of not only alienation but
anxiety and narcissism as well one cannot comprehend alienation anxiety and narcissism as a major phenomenon in
western civilization and culture without an understanding of the origin of white-skinned people and their evolved thoughts and feelings
conscious and unconscious about themselves white skin is a form of albinism there is no difference
microscopically speaking between the white skin of a white person and the skin of a person designated as an albino
my central thesis here is that the white-skinned peoples came into existence thousands of years ago as the albino
mutant offsprings of black skinned mothers and fathers in africa a sizable number of these black parents
had produced rejected and then cast out of the community their genetic defective albino offspring
to live away from the normal black skin pigmented population with the awareness of their rejection in
indian nation as in leper colonies the white tribe's eventual migration
northward to escape the intensity of the equatorial sun of the southern hemisphere left the albinos eventually
situated in the area of the world known as europe now recognized as the home of the
white tribes this early rejection of the albino offspring might be viewed as a
prehistoric pre-western civilization instance of parental rejection child neglect and abuse sexual
intercourse between the isolated albino mutants produced the white race understanding race as an isolated population sharing a
significant number of common identifying genes this pattern of isolation individual
isolating individuals with effective genetic patterns is no different than the present day practice of placing genetically abnormal
individuals in institutions away from the normal population group another current practice is the
isolation of those who are genetically different into ghettos which is an exact parallel
to the albino isolation support from my position is found in an article entitled albinism
by carl whitcop jr in a 1975 issue of natural history magazine
historically people with various pigmenting conditions including albinism have occupied a spectrum of social
positions ranging from outcasts to semi-gods montezuma emperor of the aztecs at the
time of cortez's conquest maintained a museum of living human biological curiosities
prominent among these people were numerous albinos peoples with leprosy which frequently
causes spotty pigmentation of the skin and hair are described in biblical literature
as the lowest outcasts among the san blas albinos are semi outcasts
they participate less in daytime tribal activity and are not permitted to marry biological
investigations show that as a group they are somewhat smaller and their muscles are not as well developed as
those pigmented sandblasts similarly in his article entitled kuna
moon child albinism in the journal of hereditary heredity
clyde keeler notes among other findings on albinism the voice quality of albino males is
soft and higher pitched than in moreno or normal brown males in addition they appear to be deficient in male sex
hormone and while they have may be fertile they have a lower phallic posture due to flacidity albinos usually have
flabby muscles and reduce muscular strength as shown by manometer readings psychiatric
examination of six albinos showed their work to be generally in an intellectual sphere where over
overcompensation is the rule religion serves as a major supporter for many albinos who take a
fatalistic view of life and blame their failures on their albinism which is god's will
as the usual thing sexual experience is much more limited in the albinos who until recently were not allowed to
marry while albino males have the reputation of being weakly sexed albino females are said to
be as active sexually as morenos and they frequently have illegitimate children
it should be noted that many of the sandblast albinos were indistinguishable from the scandinavians or other northern europeans the 19th
century german philosopher arthur schopenhauer made the following statement about white skin in the
philosophy of schopenhauer metaphysics of love and sexes which illuminates both whitcops and keller's
findings the white color of skin is not natural to man but that by nature
he has a black and brown skin like our forefathers the hindus that consequently a white man has never
originally sprung from the womb of nature and that thus there is no such thing as a white race
as much as this is talked of but every white man is a faded or bleached one
additional support is found in the work of dr sheikh antodia the highly respected senegalese
anthropologist and egyptologist founder of the radiocarbon institute of the fundamental institute of black africa
in dakar senegal dr diop in an interview in the winter 1976 issue of black books
bulletin stated there is absolutely no doubt the white race which appeared for the first time during the upper paleolithic
around 20 000 bc was the product of a processed depigmentation further dr diabuton forms
us that much later the whites commenced their migratory movements towards the southern areas around 1500 bc
therefore it should not be surprising that deep within the historic and current mythological and symbolism of
western civilization and culture white supremacy system culture is evidence to strongly support the
the above outline mode of origin as that actually traversed by the global albino or a white collective matter on the
streets each day major evidence for this theory of albinism or whiteness is found in the
symbolism of the adam and eve biblical mythology western civilization looks
to this mythology in the book of genesis as the account of its beginning the essential elements of the adam and
eve theory and story are that adam and eve were in a garden of eden ate the forbidden fruit
the apple had sexual intercourse became ashamed of their nakedness and were chased from the garden of eden
my decoding of that fundamental mythology and symbolism for western civilization is as follows adam and eve are the
symbolic figures of the early albino mutants produced by black parents
the garden of eden is africa the place where all knowledgeable anthropologists and paleontologists are informing us
that human life began and that the first human beings were black skinned the apple eaten by adam and eve is the
presumed orally ingested poison looked upon as the cause of the mutation
to albinism this ingestion was followed by the act of sexual intercourse which is also
viewed as being being responsible for the mutation to albinism and therefore the original sin
adam and eve's shame for their nakedness indicates the rejection and shame of their pale white bodies
colorless or naked when compared to the black and brown skin normals the use of a fig leaf to
cover their genitals as they are depicted implies the shame and rejection of their genital apparatus
including their genes their expulsion from the garden of eden represents the isolation of the albino mutants away
from the skin-pigmented normals enter voluntary or involuntary migration out of africa
northward into europe western culture goes further in the symbolism of its religious philosophy to pinpoint the
eating of the apple by adam and eve followed by their act of sexual intercourse as their act of original sin
because of this act western culture conceives of all its people as being born and sinned and in need of being
born again similarly there are several other biblical references of skin color change through god's punishment
and leprosy wherein the skin is described as becoming white as snow in second kings 5 27 of course
the further implication is that the skin originally must have been black meaning melanin pigmented otherwise how
could it turn white numbers 12 10 states and the cloud
departed from off the tabernacle and behold miriam became leprous white as snow
and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous and aaron said unto moses alas my lord i
beseech thee lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly
and wherein we have sinned to the western philosophy there are no
accounts of skin pigmented peoples in their basic religious and or philosophical texts conceiving of
themselves as being born in sin or viewing their genital apparatus and therefore their genes
as the basis of sin and evil further western civilization's religious and secular philosophy
pinpoints the activity of adam and eve in the garden of eden as the point of the fall of man the fall is the symbolic expression of
the genetic mutation to albinism and the negative projections regarding the white skin self in the global population
where the norm was black or brown skin color likewise today the modern science of genetics fused
most spontaneous mutations as negative and delterious in terms of the warfare of the organism and the
environment at least in the human population additional symbolism in western civilization and culture
lends further support to this thesis for example the dog rather than god proverbially is
considered western man's best friend this is contrary to the beliefs of skin-pigmented people regarding their
relationship to god this western concept of the dog as man's best friend is linked to the mythology
of the founding of rome according to this mythology rome was founded by two orphans
romulus and remus who were suckled by a wolf both of the wolf and the dog are canines
these two presumably white infants are said to have founded the state that began western civilization and culture
when this is decoded romulus and remus are the symbolic representatives of the early albinos who were
abandoned by their black mothers in africa as genetic mutant defectives and in the process of
the northward migration for survival were left to the dogs suckled by wolves
this decoding explains the worship and love of the dog or canine and western civilization
western man's affection for the dog is reflected in the fact that in 1978 in new york city dogs were permitted to put 250 000
pounds of fecal matter on the streets each day defiling the environment for human beings
and is this love and worship of the dog reflective in the mirror image of the words god and dog even at this advanced stage in
the expression of the evolution of western civilization and culture further as relationships among people
became more alienated western peoples are and these non-white peoples have had
have been influenced most heavily by western culture are gaining more satisfaction from feeding clothing loving and kissing canines than
in feeding clothing loving and kissing human beings western civilization's original
symbolized relationship to the canine following the african black mother's rejection to the albino
mutant offsprings undoubtedly has influenced the frequent use of the cursing expression
and son of a these degrading expressions are used pejoratively because deep within the unconscious
western or white albino psyche the rejected mutant status is viewed pejoratively
in a world where the human norm is to have hue greater insight into the sense of
alienation in western culture is provided by the use of the word mammy when whites
refer to the black female caretaker while referring to the white female caretaker as nanny clearly nanny is
something less than mammy also the words uncle and auntie used by whites toward blacks
be speaking unconscious awareness of a deep and ancient familial relationship disrupted relationships
is the origin of alienation as supported by the symbolic rituals of western fraternal organizations such as the
masons and greek fraternities and sororities the acting out of the
crossing of the burning sands gives reference to the albino mutants expulsion from africa across the burning
sands of the sahara desert out of africa and into europe this was the original alien nation experience of
the albino whites first bond in africa
from a more recent literary work than the bible the famous 19th century novelist hermann melville
and his profoundly symbolic work about the white supremacy system culture moby dick states
what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye as it sometimes he is loathed by his own
kith and kin it is the whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bears the
albino is as well made as other men has no substantive deformity and yet this
mere aspect of all pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion
why should this be so another famous american author mark twain in a collection of
articles entitled mark twain on a damned human race complements melville's assessment in his
essay skin deep twain's analysis suggests that the depth of alienation experienced by whites
albinos nearly all black and brown skins are beautiful but a beautiful white skin is rare how
rare one may learn by walking down a street in paris new york or london on a weekday
particularly an unfashionable street and keeping count of the satisfactory complexions and counters
in the course of one mile where dark complexions are masked they make the whites look bleached out
unwholesome and sometimes frankly ghastly i could notice this as a boy
down south in the slavery days before the war the splendid black satin skins of the
south african zulus and durban seemed to me to be to come very close to perfection i
can see those zoology handsome and intensely black creatures moderately clothed on loose summer
stuffs whose snowy whiteness made the black alda blacker by contrast keeping the group in
mind i compare those complexions with the white ones which are streaming past this london window
now twain continues detailing the negative attributes of white skin the
advantage is with the zulu i think he starts with a beautiful complexion and it will last him through
and as for the indian brown firm smooth blemishless pleasant and restful to the eye afraid
of no color harmonizing with all colors and adding grace to them all i think there is no sort of
chance for the average white complexion against that rich and perfect tint finally major documentation in western
literary symbolism nick explains the origin of the global white collective's alien nation and unconscious awareness
of this fact is the stark symbolism of the profoundly important work of edgar rice burroughs
the author of the tarzan series the first of this series tarzan of the apes was copyrighted in
1912 and published in 1914 before burroughs died in 1950 he had produced 26
tarzan books so significant is a tarzan symbolism for western civilization and culture that burrows company
remains a multi-million dollar industry worldwide
edgar rice burroughs is one of the largest selling authors in the world in 1975 his company estimated that more
than 150 million copies of his books had been printed into 50 languages around the world by 1980 the entire
tarzan series was being reissued tarzan is the story of a british baby lord greystroke
who was abandoned in africa at the age of nine months after his parents died the great black
apes then took care of him as the passage from tarzan of the apes relates the hunger closed the gaps between them
and lord greystroke nursed at the breast of kala the great eight it is a short leap
through the symbolism to the code that nine months after conception a white albino mutant was born to african
black parents and then abandoned the child and its anger and alienation later returns to the scene of its projection
to dominate the africans and all other non-white peoples burle stated that the name tarzan meant
white skin in the language of the apes in the 1929 copyrighted tarzan at the earth's core
13th in the series burroughs explains in more detail the sun beating down upon his naked body
had no such effect upon his skin as with the sun of the outer world under like conditions
but it did impart him a new confidence similar to that which he would have felt had he been able to retrieve his lost
apparel and in this fact he saw that he believed to be a real cause of his first embarrassment
at his nakedness it had been the whiteness of his skin that had made him seem so naked by contrast with other
creatures for this whiteness had suggested softness and weakness arousing within him a disturbing
sensation of inferiority but now as he took on his heavy coat of tan and his feet became hardened and
accustomed to the new conditions he walked no longer in constant realization of his nakedness just as burroughs
reveals this deep preoccupation of the white collective and tarzan we still find a white collective neurotically concerned with their white
skin nakedness developing some sun tanning parlors so as to produce a permanent state of brown skin coloration
for example newsweek printed an article in december 1979 entitled 90 second sun tans in which one sun lamp
devotee when reminded of the hazards of sun tanning stated if tanning is going to kill me at least
i'll go i'll be a good looking corpse the american cancer society estimates
that the 1980 figure for new cases of skin cancer is 14 0001 while an estimated 6
200 persons will die from a specific skin cancer melanoma despite these warnings sun tanning
persists a cursory glands at any beach or swimming pool today will provide a clear
indication of the present number of white-skinned persons who are self-alienated even to the point of increasing their potential for cancer
cause death they continue to pursue temporary skin pigmentation even unto death to become members of the
human family the symbolic profundity of all of the above should leave little doubt that
white's awareness of the origin of their alienation is in no sense superficial this awareness goes deep into the genetic
core of white people's status has mutated albinism variance into the core
of the concept and image of self as such the western brain computer individual and collective
then spawns patterns of its specific alienation in its myths symbols logic thought speech action
emotional response and perception in all areas of people activity economics education entertainment labor
law politics religion sex and war anxiety more briefly the core aspects of anxiety
and narcissism in western civilization and culture which are integrally associated with the dynamic of alienation
must be discussed in dr rahul may in this book the meaning of anxiety correctly informs us in the forward to
the 1950 edition and for the past 100 years psychologists philosophers social historians and other
students of humanity have been increasingly preoccupied with their nameless and formless uneasiness that has dogged the footsteps of modern
man yet in all that time to my knowledge only two attempts have been made in book form one essay by
kiergard and one by freud to present an objective picture of anxiety and to indicate
constructive methods of dealing with it 27 years later in the forward to the revised edition
dr may states i believe a bold theory is necessary that will comprehend not only our normal and
neurotic anxiety but anxiety and literature art and philosophy as well this theory
must be formulated at our highest level of abstraction i propose that this theory be founded on the definition and anxiety
is the experience of being affirming itself against non-being the latter is which would reduce or
destroy being such as aggression fatigue boredom and untimely death
i have rewritten this book in the hope of its publication will aid in the forming of this theory of anxiety
dr may continues in the statement of the book's purpose despite the fact that anxiety has become
a central problem to so many diverse areas in our culture the attack of the problem has been handicapped by the fact that
the various theories and studies of anxiety have to date been uncoordinated and despite of the
industrious work by skilled psychologists this is true of the 1977 as it was in 1950
as an evident to anyone reading the papers from various symposia on anxiety we do not even use them the
same language freud's description of the state of the problem in the opening paragraph of this chapter on anxiety published in 1935 is
still largely accurate you will not be surprised to hear that i have a great deal of new information to
give you about our hypothesis on the subject of anxiety and also that none of the information
claims to provide a final solution to these doubtful problems what is necessary at the present stage of the understanding of anxiety is the
introduction of the right abstract ideas and of their application to the raw material and observations so as to bring
order and lucidity into it now it is clear that the distinguished dr may and
regarding neurotic anxiety took into account for his discussion of neurotic anxiety as most fundamentally related to the
birth trauma and to the fear of castration dr may later broadened the concept
writing it is very suggested to that the first anxiety state arose on the occasion of the separation
from the mother dr may continues referring to the danger of castration as
a reaction to a loss to a separation of which the prototype is the birth experience
he also includes analysis of other noted psychologists and concerning anxiety although rank's view of anxiety is
stemming from the central problem of individual individualization and in the fear of
life and the form and the fear of death alfred adler's view of anxiety as related to feelings
of inferiority jung's belief that anxiety is the individual's reaction to the invasion of his conscious mind
by irrational forces and images from the collective unconscious karen horny's view of a anxiety is a
reaction to the threat to something belonging to the core of the personality coupled with the hostility response
and finally harry stack sullivan's view of anxiety as apprehension of interpersonal
disapproval however dr may recognized that these theories including his own
being affirming itself against non-being remain insufficient now i also view these approaches as
insufficient and conclude as argued in my earlier discussion of alienation and anxiety
in the western civilization and culture stems from the origin of that culture which rests most fundamentally in the
production of albino mutants from the black parents in africa
anxiety like alienation in western culture is the result of the rejection of these albinos because of their genetic deficiency
status and their subsequent abandonment and migration northward to form what is now recognized as the
white race this global white collective maintains a different appearance from the rest of humankind
and they dislike this difference therefore they tan and use makeup they remain a minority of
the world's people surrounded globally by black brown red and yellow global majority
the white global collective remains genetically recessive to the black brown red and yellow global majority and lives
each day in each minute of every hour in the continuous fear of white alien annihilation by the global majority of
genetic dominance this fundamental fear of albino isolation abandonment and genetic
annihilation is at the core of western civilization a civilization structured to ensure
white genetic survival the survival plan necessitates the subjugation and control
of all non-white peoples are defined as subjugation and control as the white supremacy system
because the conscious overt dialogue and the whole of western civilization and culture is never about its global white
minority status its recessive therefore vulnerable genetic status or its initial rejection by the black
parents in a black majority these feelings about self and fears of inadequacy and vulnerability reside
underground in the brain computer these subconscious and unconscious
thoughts become the basis for the pervasive neurotic anxiety that characterizes western culture
such as the specific nature and cause of this nameless and formless uneasiness that has dogged the footsteps of modern
man modern man means western man means white man means the
global white collective this is the reason that valium or
diazepam is the most prescribed drug in the u.s the key unit of western civilization and
culture is the same anxiety that causes western civilization's preoccupation with weapons spending more money on armaments
than on any other single budgetary item these weapons surround all of the world's non-white peoples
the whites hope that the weapons will prevent white genetic annihilation and thereby ensure white genetic
survival but then whites hold the pervasive attendant fear that they will be destroyed in the
conflagration also this fundamental anxiety relative to
global white genetic annihilation pervades all patterns and symbols logic thought speech action emotional
response and perception in all areas of people activity within western culture and civilization
also pervades all aspects of family life for whites and all non-white victims of
white supremacy all the aforementioned theories of anxiety by freud young
frank adler horny sullivan and may are encompassed in the above stated crest wilson thesis on anxiety and western
civilization and culture narcissism narcissism
just as alienation anxiety have become key focus of
key foci of attention for western behavioral and social scientists and other scholars narcissism has become the most recent
abstraction for intense intellectual involvement the january 30th 1978 newsweek article
entitled the new narcissism outlined several qualities of narcissism
long before social critic tom wolf labeled the 1970s the me decade scholars were exploring
narcissism as a new perhaps even dominant psychological pattern of both individual and social
behavior according to this theory the new narcissist suffers and emotionally dies because
like his mythological prototype he cannot return anyone's affection his fatal flaw however is not really
self-love but a grandiose expectation of himself that cannot be sustained and makes him vulnerable to chronic
bouts of boredom and inner emptiness in the eyes of the new narcissist the outside world is essentially a
mirror that reflects his own alternative feelings of personal omnipotence and disintegration to dr ernest wolfe of
the chicago institute of psychoanal analysis the identification of the new narcissism signals a major revolution in
psychoanalyst analysis in which self-esteem is seen as
just as important as sexuality for social historian christopher lash narcissism is the key to understanding
why self-preservation and psychic survival pervade the moral climate of contemporary society
at a recent conference on narcissism in modern society at the university of michigan several psychiatrists argued that there
are still no solid clinical data proving that narcissism has increased in relation to traditional neurosis
others such as psychologist kenneth keniston wonder whether a clinical term like narcissism can properly explain
patterns of social behavior nonetheless through a series of books essays and symposiums the new narcissism
has emerged as a central intellectual concern a poise frodian school of psychoanalysis
based in chicago has proclaimed pathological narcissism to be setting psychological
disorder of modern western culture and has developed a psychology of itself to explain its causes and some social
scientists have adopted clinical descriptions of narcissism to help explain the declining interest in
politics social action and child rearing and the corresponding rise of an individual
survival ethic pathological narcissists simply cannot depend on others
which for me is a crucial characteristic says new york psychoanalyst otto f kernberg author of the
influential study borderline conditions of pathological narcissism much as they crave admiration says dr
kernberg narcissists systematically exploit and devalue others frequently charming and charismatic they
tend to enjoy only fleeting emotional contacts rather than genuine long-term intimacy narcissists
are often highly successful in business bureaucracies and other interpersonal organizations typically which
such situations reward those who can manipulate others while discouraging personal attachments
and providing enough emotional feedback to satisfy self-esteem
the third diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders in 1980 published by the american psychiatric
association contains a description of the narcissistic personality disorder
but the following stated criteria a grandiose sense of self-importance or uniqueness
b preoccupation with fantasies or unlimited success power brilliance beauty or ideal love c
exhibitionistic requires constant attention and admiration d responds to criticism and difference
of others or defeat with either cool indifference or with marked feelings of rage inferiority shame
humiliation or emptiness e two of the following one lack of empathy inability to
recognize how others feel two entitlement expectation of special favors with reactions or surprise and
anger when others don't comply three interpersonal exploitivenessness
takes advantage of others to indulge his own desires or for self-aggrandizement
with disregards for the personal integrity and rights of others four relationships characteristically
facilitate between the extremes of over-idealization and devaluation any non-white person who
has had extensive experience with whites collectively or as individuals will find in the above
a description of those relationships at a superficial level it seems ironic that those
responsible for including this disorder in a diagnostic and statistical manual
have failed to recognize this as a statement that characterizes the global relationship of whites to non-whites
a description of white supremacy dynamic or racism for further understanding of this
perceptual failure let us return to the greek myth of narcissists
according to greek mythology narcissus was the son of the river god cephasis in a nymph larioca
he was distinguished for his beauty his mother was told that he would have a long life provided he never looked upon
his own features however this rejection of the love of the nymph echo
or his lover anemias drew upon him in the vengeance of the gods he fell in love with his own reflection
in the waters of a spring and pined away or killed himself this ancient mythological symbolism displays the
difficulty the white collective has in looking in the mirror to see itself for what it truly is in relationship to the vast
majority of the world's people indeed if it faces itself with its puffed-up attitude of white superiority
it will disintegrate narcissism as described but not deeply understood by fraud is germane to
this thesis freud viewed narcissism as a character disorder in which there is was a fixation
and libidinal energy upon itself because of a lack of love or response to the part of the parents
the libidinal energy never can be discharged upon another person with satisfaction distrust of other persons and
relationships persist into adult life so that the narcissistic character prefers
auto eroticism i.e masturbation to normal sexual intercourse ford and
others have failed to understand that the failure of parental love is rooted in the original rejection by the black mothers and black fathers in
africa of their albino white mutant offspring who were forced to try to love themselves that they were to
survive but they could not arrive at the point of true self-acceptance because there were never parental and group
acceptance or validation at the time that the whites mutated from blacks because whites failed to be
accepted by the original black parents they evolved a subsequent compensatory pattern of white supremacy
yet beneath the stance of white supremacy and white grandiosity the insecurity of inadequacy inferiority
and vulnerability remains to be displayed alternatively alternately
long long ago the greeks were cautioned by the oracle of delphi whom the greeks betrayed in the
eponymous hero delphis as a negro to know thyself clearly to date the
western collective has failed in his task the isis papers chapter three unified
Chapter 3 - PAGES 39-52
field theory psychiatry yet do i marvel at this curious thing to
make a poet black and bid him sing county cullen
is it conceivable that a black who is also a woman can critique and dismantle the whole of western psychiatry
i'll begin this essay somewhat differently than it was originally conceived several years ago this alteration is occasioned by having
read the article retreat behind new walls seen posing danger for psychiatry which appeared in the june 1980 issue of
clinical psychiatry news it is a report from san francisco on the address given by dr alan m stone
as outgoing president at the annual meeting of the american psychiatric association dr stone stated the new walls are being
built as psychiatrists attempt to deal with the issues of racism homosexuality and its situation of women
these are all issues which have confronted us in our practice challenged the moral assumption that lie
concealed in our theories and confounded us with disputes and acrimony in our association
it is no accident that each issue invites psychiatry to take a stand on human values
human values after all are a crucial link in a chain that binds itself to society to take a stand on and reveal something
about our own selves our own relations to society and our own vision of what it means to love
and to work many psychiatrists believe that the apa should limit itself to issues that are clearly psychiatric but many
others believe that these social issues are clearly psychiatric i shall claim that the what separate
separates these two groups can only be understood as part of the deep theoretical dilemma in which american psychiatry
finds itself its lack of conceptual clarity this theoretic ambig ambiguity is the
core of the conflict which confronts psychiatric psychiatry as pragmatic eclectic certain that we
have put pieces of the picture together correctly we can never be confident that we can distinguish between a sick
patient and a sick society psychiatry's contribution to what it means to be a person is its most
powerful aspect that contribution cannot be under psychiatry's control in a free society
however the profession has a responsibility for the hidden values in his theories and therapies which contribute to the
shaping of contemporary consciousness it is in the issues surrounding the subject of women that perhaps the most
convincing attack on the hidden values in psychiatry has been made dr stone continued his discussion asking
if these issues cut deeper into american psychiatry than racism and homosexuality
as far as i can see the case against psychiatry as it regards women is far more damaging requires far more than a minor
adjustment of our composite sketch indeed it compels each of us to re-examine not only our theories
but also our lives and relationships there can be no new psychology of women that does not require a new psychology
of men that makes necessary a new conception of all of our human values and all the paradigms of psychiatry
psychiatry does not stand outside of history or morality but how do psychiatrists
decide which history and which morality to accept the rules about which history and which morality
to accept are not clearly described in the biologic psychodynamic and behavioral paradigms
what is required of us is moral ambition until our composite sketch becomes a true portrait of humanity
we must live with our uncertainty we will grope we will struggle and our compassion may be only
our only guide and comfort originally my essay began with the statement it is clear to many that the great
problems are confronting the field of psychiatry at theoretical and conceptual levels this crisis
has important implications for treatment as well as the problems encountered in formulating diagnostic categories as
evidence in the controversy surrounding the task of developing diagnostic and statistical manual the third
but who better should state the problem facing psychiatry in america than an outgoing president of the american
psychiatric association indeed who would be more readily believed than he will not accepting all that was said by
dr stone most specifically his view of sexism as a more problematic issue than racism i do share
his awareness of a floundering chaos in psychiatry's current theoretical and conceptual state
it was this very awareness that led me to the consideration of a unified field theory in psychiatry
the concept of a unified field theory is derived from the work of the great physician or physicist albert einstein march 14
1879 april 18 1955 einstein a mathematical physicist
the most recognized and highly renowned scientist in the history of the western civilization spent the greater portion of his productive years
in search of a unified field theory a theory that in mathematical terms by a single set of equations would
combine all of the different manifestations of energy phenomenon in the universe einstein stated the force of gravity and
produced a general theory of relativity he studied the forces of electromagnetism and produced a special
theory of relativity which became a more accurate yardstick for measuring the characteristics of the physical world
then einstein questioned the possibility of generalizing the mathematical foundations of the theory to derive not
only the properties of the gravitational field but also those of the electromagnetic field his work is reviewed in ronald
clark's 1971 einstein the life and times in einstein's own words
for years it has been my greatest ambition to resolve the duality of natural laws and to unity this duality
lies in the fact that physicists have hit the two being compelled to postulate two sets of laws
those which control gravitation and those which control the phenomena of electricity and magnetism
many physicists have suspected that two sets of laws must be based upon one general law
but neither experiment nor theory has until now succeeded in formulating this law the
relativity theory reduced to one formula all laws which govern space time and gravitation
and thus it corresponds to the demand for simplification of our physical concepts the purpose of my work is to further
this simplification and particularly to reduce to one formula the explanation of the
field of gravity in the field of electromagnetism for this reason i call it contribution to a
unified field theory now but only now we know that the force which moves electrons in their ellipse
about the nuclei of atoms is the same force that moves our earth in its annual course about the sun and
is the same force which brings us the rays of light and heat which make life possible on this planet
not only did einstein die before achieving this goal but prior to his death his conceptualization of unified field
theory was being dismissed by younger physicists as the ideas of an old man whose scientific usefulness had passed long
ago quantum physics in the physics of chance and statistical probabilities the physics of born in heisenberg were
supplanting the einsteinian physics of the whole this was the new physics of in
indeterminacy this new physics could be characterized by sir george thompson's following statements
which appear in einstein the life and times wherever a system is really complicated
as in a brain or in any organized community interdeterminancy become comes in not
necessarily because of age plank's constant but because to make a
prediction so many things must be known that the stray consequences of studying then will disturb the status quo which
can never therefore be discovered history is not and cannot be determined the supposed causes
only may produce the consequences we expect i'm almost certain that most workers in
the field of psychiatry are not consciously aware that they too have assured a position in the respective scientific camps of
either albert einstein or that of born in heisenberg the camp of india in indeterminacy
holds as articulated by sir george thompson that in a system as complicated as the brain or an
organized community one cannot uncover a unitary law or unitary cause of the many complex forms
of behavior knowledge of which would enable prediction of expected consequences
on the contrary the camp of determinancy concludes that in any finite energy system no matter how seemingly
complex at the surface level a unitary law can be discerned simply because there is specific order in the
universe and thus there is order in any given energy system a unitary law would reveal the nature of that specific order
i reside in the albert einstein camp the camp of determinancy
einstein's effort towards uncovering the unified field has great meaning to me as a psychiatrist
behavioral scientist because it is my developing conviction that the present confusion is largely a result of
our failure to see the interconnections that exist between many seemingly isolated
disconnected behavior energy phenomenon in western culture actually there are very few if any
workers in behavioral science who perceive the necessity to research out on the on one hand these
interconnections and on the other hand to unveil the total unified form that is structured by these interconnections and
their fundamental cause or ideology this may be said in a reverse order
because there is a failure on the part of most investigators to perceive the total outline of the western cultural dynamic
it is difficult if not impossible for them to make sense of the isolated behavior patterns within a total behavior system framework
behavioral scientists thus frustrated have tried to find the answers in statistics
neurochemical molecules and genes it was the same limitation and dependence on a
statistical method of analyzing energy phenomenon that depressed einstein in the work of his colleagues in physics
he lamented that they could not see the larger picture
they lacked his intuitive faculty to see at a deeper and more encompassing level
this may be best understood if we look at the scattered pieces of a 1 000 piece jigsaw puzzle for which the outlining border has not yet
been set in place generally speaking one cannot make heads or tails of the scattered tiny
pieces once the outliner context has been established the order in which the small pieces are
to be placed immediately becomes clear i used a particular introduction for this brief essay because a
total behavioral energy system also can be seen and understood as a unified field of
energy phenomena once that unified field of behavioral energy is perceived and described
setting forth its etiology and dynamic the once seemingly isolated little understood and often unexamined
individual phenomenon of behavioral energy within the field are seen in brilliant coerce coherence
whereas before they were neither visualized or understood adequately a parallel process can be seen in the
recent discoveries in physics of strange celestial objects such as quasars pulsars and
black holes the discovery of which can be seen as dependent upon iron science concept of
unified field the framework of his relativity concept
the global white supremacy system or racism is highly specific system of behavior
energy the force and energy of the system through its ultimate goal objective and its patterns of logic thought speech
action emotional response perception and symbols in all areas of people activity economics education entertainment labor
law politics religion sex and war determines the dominant patterns of behavior in the world today
the global system of white supremacy is euphemistically referred to as western civilization
in chapter one i explained that the global behavior patterns of racism are a survival necessity for the white
collective this racist activity is a compensatory attempt to prevent white genetic annihilation on a planet where
the vast majority of peoples are genetically dominant to the melanin deficient whites
the awareness of self in a white global collective as a white genetic mutant population that was rejected by their
black parents in africa see chapter 2 and a subsequent conscious and or unconscious determination to survive as
a global minority became the underlying law that determined the evolution of the now global white supremacy system culture
all major and minor behavior energy crystallizations are behavior units in the global white
collective no matter how simple or complex old or new short or long lived must conform in a final
analysis to the basic behavior energy equation of white over non-white
or white power over non-white powerlessness this is the necessary power or energy
equation for white genetic survival this behavior energy equation is expressed in energy manifestations of
pattern of logic thought speech action emotional response and perception in all areas
of people activity from this basic law it becomes possible to predict the ultimate output of individual and
collective white brain computers at the local and global levels in energy terms this
means that as it is possible to predict the fundamental patterns the bottom line of all energy that flows
from the white collective and its dynamic interactions with the non-white collective that some total of behavior energy
expression is always the energy crystallization of white supremacy white genetic survival irrespective of
the gross of subtle myriad behavior forms it assumes also this energy formation can be
understood as a finite unified energy field or force field albeit that the force is
behavior energy this new theory of psychiatry is what i refer to as a unified field theory
psychiatry it is a psychiatry that perceives a definable whole
global system of behavior energy wherein the behavior events lend themselves to prediction because
the ultimate objective of the system remains constant the basic considerations that einstein proposed for physical energy and his
concept of unified field theory can be applied readily to behavior energy in the concept of unified field theory psychiatry
thus the role of all major and minor patterns of behavior within the field can be understood and even predicted
now the underlying inner relationships between seemingly unconnected patterns of behavior are visible it is though
the end of a knotted ball or skein yarn has been discovered that with patience permits complete
unraveling without breaks in the yarn heretofore the western behavior scientist had recognized
the single connection thread of logic permeating seemingly unrelated phenomenon such as lynching smoking objects bullfights chocolate
candy with nuts coffee guns umbrellas automobiles skiing race races and racing
horse foot and car the adam and eve mythology moby dick dracula frankenstein the play
equus by peter schaefer paper money gold christian religious symbolism the
swat the nazi swastika anti-semitism sexual perversions apartheid child abuse
capitalism nudism the holocaust alienation sexism homosexuality pornography
narcissism gambling rape flags men's ties etc all of the above are but a few of
the major behavior energy entities bits and symbols included in the white supremacy
system culture that are related to the single underlying law governing the origin and continued existence of western
civilization western social and behavioral science particularly psychiatry has been content with behavior fragment
analysis and multiple theoretical explanations for different behaviors this demonstrates a failure to
comprehend the entire forest while focusing on isolated trees or clumps of trees failure to comprehend
the whole behavior energy forest field has resulted in isolated behavior modification techniques and programs
the inability to grasp the manner in which the total social structure determines the behavior of the individual personality and a
tendency to focus on isolated neurochemical sequences and mechanic and mechanisms as causing certain
behavior pattern constellations this limited pattern of perception and the apparently necessary pattern of
endless abstracting with an inability to synthesize the whole may be predicated upon a pattern
of data reception in a nervous system of persons who possess insufficient levels of melanin in their
nervous system the lack of melanin results from the genetic deficiency state of albinism or
its variants which in turn influences basic patterns of perception or energy messages from the physical social
environment i will examine this possibility in a future work understanding this it is clear that
current western psychiatry's inability to identify the inner relationships existing between racism
homosexuality and sexism articulated by dr alan stone is due to an inadequate conceptual and theoretical
base as stated previously racism is the evolved behavior energy system
predicated upon a need for white genetic survival both homosexuality and sexism are
derivatives of the fundamentals dynamic the forces in the white supremacy system
that lead to a massive increase of passivity a feminization by sexuality and homosexuality in the
black male population as necessities for white genetic survival are discussed in chapter six
however to specifically focus on white male homosexuality in the white supremacy culture
we must return to the male albino mutants awareness of himself in contrast to the prototypic human male
the black male the father of the early albino mutants indeed this fact is the true basis for the
oedipus mythology historically white males worldwide have suffered a deep sense of male
inferiority and inadequacy because they represent a mutant genetically recessive minority
population that can be genetically annihilated by all nine white non-white people males and females ultimately this
awareness in the white collective has produced high levels of masculine self-doubt
fear anxiety and self-alienation these difficulties have been intensified by the awareness that white
reproductivity is far lower than the natural reproductivity of any non-white population thus the white male
collective feels vulnerable to the global non-white male collective but most specifically to the
black male collective because of black's ability to produce the highest level of melanin and their by the greatest potential for white
genetic annihilation this basic logic of discuss with the white genetic and
genital self drives the brain computer in a white male collective to self negating patterns of behavior also it is
the basis of the continuing question in white collective who has the largest penis
the black or white male at another level white male homosexuality may be viewed
as a symbolic attempt to incorporate into the white male body more male substance by either
sucking the penis of another male or orally ingesting the semen or by having male ejaculate deposited in
one end of the elementary canal through anal intercourse to self-debasing white male
may fantasize that he can produce a product of color albeit that the product of color is fecal
matter this fantasy is significant for white males because the male who are able to produce skin color are viewed as
the real men the same sense of maleness deficiency in a white supremacy culture
causes the behavior patterns of smoking either small white phallic symbols called cigarettes
large dark brown or black phallic symbols known as cigars pipes and long brown cigarettes called
moors or does it mean moors these are sucked swallowed puffed and
otherwise bodily ingested ultimately leading to self-negation through potential cancer-caused deaths
also should be noted that for the white male collective the greatest sense of male power comes from smoking the large
dark brown phallic smoking objects cigars and pipes thus cigars are given at birth of a sun
similarly the sense of maleness deficiency elevates the gun to such important status in the white supremacy
culture see chapter eight white male homosexuality is reinforced in the white family
wearing the white male's sense of genetic inadequacy causes him to project his sense of genetic inferiority
onto the white female she's forced to accept the concept of her own genetic inferiority compared to white males
an angry reaction to the white male attack she causes her white suns to negate their masculinity and to become
more like himself herself as a female also the white male must oppress the white female because
the latter proclaims that her ideal sex partner is tall dark and handsome
should the white female be permitted to have her freedom and to sexually aggress against the dark man non-white male white genetic
annihilation will occur the two above factors white male projecting their sense of genetic
inferiority on the white females and two white males fear the white females in their preference
for black and non non-white males will become participants in white genetic annihilation have resulted in
what western culture now refers to as sexism the repression of white females
by white males in a white supremacy system culture presently white females are responding
collectively to white males and pose sense of genetic inferiority through their struggle for equality
with white males large numbers of white females are proclaiming themselves lesbians believing that this is a
constructive response to their sense of inadequacy they of course fail to realize that these behaviors arise from the fact that
they have been taught to degrade their genetic makeup says white females in the subtle dynamics of white family life
thus they move into behaviors of non-self-reproduction and self-negation also in white females
drive to be equal to the white males they've increased greatly the practice of sucking on the white phallic symbols
cigarettes causing a sharp increase in her incidence of self-negation through lung cancer
white females fail to understand that while they strive to become the same as white males they become more
alienated from their genetic selves thus they fall victim to the dynamic of genetic alienation the central core of
racism as they participate in the finite unified energy field of white genetic
survival whether one examines the microcosm of the individual white personality or the macrocosm of the
global white collective the law of white genetic survival stands that law can be stated in the following
equation white power over non-white powerlessness or a w over nw nonetheless
the implication of the law for whites is a failure of individual and collective white self-respect
based on a negative image and concept of the self in a white collective there is self-esteem
which is a compensatory inflated sense of the self but there is not fundamental respect for
the genetic white self the implications for psyche psychiatry are as follows
on the basis of negative image and concept of the self the brain computer evolves patterns of neurochemistry logic thought
speech action emotional response and perception that are self and group negating
and productive of disharmony in the universe these are patterns of neurochemistry and behavioral con
consistent with various degrees of mental illness on the basis of a positive self-image
and self-concept the brain computer evolves patterns of neurochemistry logic thought speech action
emotional response and perception that are self and group supporting and productive of harmony in the universe
these are patterns of neural chemistry and behavior consistent with mental health the following diagrams show the
environmental factors that act upon a genetic and constitutional base to form the self image and self concept factors that
support the self lead to positive self images and self concepts whereas factors that deny the self lead to
negative self images and self concepts the task of psychiatry
is to help the individual in a collective achieve genuine genetic self-respect and thereby respect for others in all
aspects of the universe psychiatry's further task is to demonstrate the white supremacy system
is unable to produce an environment in which mental health can evolve and flourish therefore that power
system needs to be abandoned for a more productive one this unified field theory psychiatry concept of mental health
and mental illness challenges the victim of sigmund freud that mental health is the ability to work and to love the global white
supremacy system culture constitutes a finite unified behavior energy field the single unitary law of genetic
survival governs its origin and its continuance homosexuality and sexism are necessary
derivatives of this energy field and just like all of the significant behaviors in the global and local white
collective can be understood as derivatives of this finite unified behavior energy field it is knowledge of the unitary
causative law that governs this field and enables the prediction of future behavior energy patterns within
it the above discussion then serves as background to the essays which follow all dominant behaviors in
the white supremacy system culture are derivatives of this central concern and its secondary and tertiary
elaborations and compensations which also are concerned with white genetic survival
together these behavior patterns produced the white supremacy unified behavior field albert einstein
realized that we needed a law to guide us in and around a phenomenon in the organized energy systems of the
physical universe so that our movements and interactions in that universe could be facilitated
similarly we need a law to guide us in the evolved energy system of white supremacy behavior organization
in order to facilitate our movement in that system with the ultimate goal being truth justice harmony and peace contrary to
the fears of dr alan sohn new walls are being built in psychiatry the old walls of artificial abstractions
are being torn down and in their place stands a new edifice a unified field which can be used to diagnose treat and
cure the isis papers chapter four learning to

look at symbols a culture can be likened to a quilt of intricate geometrical design in
which all of the many colored pieces their shapes and stitching flow into one another constitute the hole this analogy is app
for yet a second reason often the design on the upper side of the quilt is different from the under
surface pattern still the under surface design is essential for the outward surface appearance
i have given myself the task of decoding the culture in which i find myself in time and space that culture is the dominating global
power for system culture of white supremacy or racism this decoding amounts to turning over
examining and laying bare the intricate pattern pieces underlying the culture and power system
showing in sharp relief its lines of force and determination and thus its overall design only by doing so
is it possible to see where we are going in the existing dense white fog counter racist psychiatry defines mental
health as patterns of logic thought speech action emotional response and perception consciously practiced by
the victims of white supremacy or racism but the objective of eradicating racism
at the global level functionally speaking for the victims of white supremacy this means to
act in a self group respecting and supporting manner in all areas of people activity despite the specific conditions
of racist domination and oppression submission to in cooperation with victimization and depression are signs
of individual or group mental illness or self-negation once the victims of
oppression accurately and completely decode the system and its objective of oppression and once they fully realize and analyze
the symbols and patterns of logic thought speech action emotional response and perception consciously or
unconsciously determined they constitute the system the oppressed will be able to reorganize
their own behavior effectively this reorganization will result in self-group respect
and self and support and thereby end their oppression the process of decoding a power system
and its culture is a necessary first step to achieve behavioral mastery over the system culture the attainment of such mastery is an
essential step in the process of total liberation for the victims who wish to end that oppression and regain
their self-respect and mental health without this process of decoding their press fail to fully understand what they
are dealing with they have minimal levels of consciousness and self-group respect and they are functionally speaking
mentally ill this decoding activity entails the unraveling and analysis of all the
various products of individual and collective brain activity within a given culture these brain products appear and are
reflected in all areas of people activity economics education entertainment including games and sports
labor law politics religions sex and war this means analysis of products of
conscious as well as unconscious brain activity patterns of logic thought speech action emotion response perception dreams
symbols and intuition will be required a special importance are the brain
products that issue force from those who are white and whose presently control the power balance in the global power
system of white supremacy and who thus produce the dominant themes and trends within the system and culture framework symbols are highly
extracted condensed and decoded messages that are developed by the activity of the brain computer
in the human organism these messages are developed and evolved from energy sensory data received in the brain from
the external environment various lines of energy data from the total environment coverage on a brain computer
via the nervous system which can then under the proper circumstances lead to the development of a symbol thus
symbols reflect certain aspects of the external environment and a total body's internal
environmental response to the external environment musical notes on paper as well as
written and spoken words are symbols there are other kinds of symbols that are not as immediately translated or
fully understood because of their highly abstract forms and complexity the impact of these complex symbols reach
subconscious and unconscious levels of brain activity these complex symbols are in effect full sentences paragraphs
or entire books of data stated in a highly abstracted single image or line configuration
once the symbol is formed it is capable of acting upon the brain computer which receives it as an energy or data message this
message affects the end product of behavior as carried forth in any area of human activity the symbol in turn acts upon the
external environment these single picture sentences or single picture paragraphs commence in
the brain computer and act as powerful undetected persuaders and thus as powerful determinants of
behavioral patterns these complex symbols are usually related to the deepest cultural themes
of a people and have significant messages to convey about the people and cultures reason for being
furthermore these reasons are passed on uncensored in the unconscious via the total environmental experience
from the beginning of people time generation to generation in this manner
the symbols act as a stirring rod that agitates the unconscious sending out energy responses in the form of thought speech
action and emotions in the opinion of the hindu philosopher ananda k
kusarami symbolism is the art of thinking in images and art now lost to
civilized man however this law says anthropology and psychoanalysis is shown is limited to consciousness and not to
the unconscious which is to compensate is perhaps now overloaded with symbolic material
he goes on to state that to know the rational and the deeply irrational is the mark of
truthful living that is a fully alive perception of the conditions of one's life
the major forms of symbolism in a power system culture constitute powerful and subtle messages about how and why the culture came into being
and what the people must be must do to survive and maintain itself symbolism is thus the glue that holds
the individual and collective psyche of the people and its culture together the keys to the system culture are found in a decoded
symbolism of that system culture symbols and brain process carl gustav
jones was the major european behavior scientist to emphasize the importance of symbols their production and their meaning in
the brain's total process and behavioral output nevertheless this massive volume of work
is taken a lesser place to that accorded sigmund freud in the late 19th to 20th centuries of western
white thought however it should be remembered that the understanding and use of symbols included in the
interpretation of dreams reached their highest development in african and asian culture and was a
major significance in these cultures dating back to the earliest time pre-history long before there was any
european cultural development according to june the symbol is the primitive expression to the unconscious
but at the same time it is also an idea corresponding to the highest institution produced by consciousness
additionally in his word psyche and symbols he had the following to say about symbols
since the symbol is the most complete expression of that which in any given epoch is as yet unknown and cannot
be replaced by any other statement at the time it must proceed from the complex and subtle strata of the contemporary
psychological atmosphere conversely the effective living symbol must also contain something which is
shared by considerable numbers of men it embraces that which is common to a larger group
consequently it must include those primitive elements emotional and otherwise whose omnipresence stands
beyond all doubt only when the symbol comprehends all those and conveys them with ultimate
force kennedy vocal universe universal response therein resides the
powerful and redeeming effect of the living social symbol also it has been said that symbols are
always paradoxical since they contain elements that do not exist in logic june thought that the elements
combined with symbols and contradictory only to the logic of consciousness but that nonetheless they conform to a basic
reality that eludes conscious thought processes a genuine symbol is an image which possesses two
essential features it originates with the archetypal ground of the psyche and secondly there exists a
consciousness to apprehend it in an article entitled contribution of june jungian psychotherapy towards
understanding the creative process george boaz states the beauty of myth
and symbol lies in their synthetic power they can combine in one presentation
disparate elements which would be self-contradictory if put in a declarative sentence normal
brown and love's body has stated that the axis on which world history is symbolism from figaro to veritas translation from
symbol to truth the axis of the world history is making conscious and unconscious
brown further states that symbolism is between conscious and unconscious june explains in his book
that man and his symbols approaching the unconscious assemble is a term a name or even a picture that may be familiar in daily
life yet that possesses specific connotations in addition to its conventional and obvious meaning
it implies something vague unknown or hidden from us now he continues a word in a word or an
image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning it has a wider unconscious aspect it is
never precisely defined or fully explained he further informs us that as the mind
explores the symbol it has led to ideas that lie beyond the grasp of reason
june's work indicates that a true symbol appears only when there is a need to express a thought one cannot
openly think or what is only divined or felt
recent neurological studies suggest that the silent right cerebral hemisphere is the source of activity leading to
phenomenon such as symbol formation other studies demonstrate that the left cerebral hemisphere seems more concerned
with the logical processes or of directed more consciously controlled thinking by contrast the activities of the right
cerebral hemisphere may be subject to different laws that are as yet a little understood
in addition the right and less temperature appears capable of independent simultaneous thought
also it has been suggested that collaboration of the two contradictory modes associated with
right and left hemispheric activity may account to the symbolic process and for creativity a diagram one
illustrates the process by which the brain computer uses sensory data received from the surrounding environment to form symbols and other
brain computer products clearly many forms and levels of data
messages from a physical and social environment are input in the brain computer some of the sensory that is
coded as the level of of consciousness but because of the large scope of attended
perception unattended perceptions much of the data is coded at the unconscious levels of brain
activity as some neurologists would state this data is dispersed between the left and right cerebral hemispheres respectively
for example within the framework of a given system and culture certain perceptions may exist that never are acknowledged overtly and
certain ideas thoughts concepts and theories are that are uttered rarely if ever these perceptions and words
ideas concepts and theories that are repressed or channeled into the unconscious level of the brain computer
becomes an entire world of ideas treated as though they never existed in the form of concrete reality
nonetheless the data from the environment that is encoded at the unconscious level of the brain computer actually does not
disappear just as the objective data that produce the repressed ideas and concepts do not
disappear there simply ceases to be a clear focus on this body of data this repressed data becomes the
substratum from which symbols can be formed i stated previously the dominant aspect of the total environmental
reality on the planet is that the overwhelming majority of people are black brown red and yellow
this fact has created the most fundamental collective preoccupation and perhaps fear in a global white
collective of white genetic survival a survival that is threatened by the genetic material contained in the
genitals of black men and other non-white men non-white people are genetically dominant to whites and
thus our potential genetic annihilators of the minority white collective due to this fear of white genetic
annihilation the global white collective has evolved during the last two thousand years the global white supremacy system
and culture that dominates all black brown red and yellow peoples in the world determining their behavior in all areas
of people activity the isis papers chapter 5 the symbolism

of christ the cross the crucifix to communion dedication this essay is dedicated to
all the black men who are in greater confinement prisons and jails with the hope that they will be encouraged never to give up
the struggle against white supremacy domination and justice once they understand what the struggle is truly all about
then they will never return to jail and their behavior no longer will be anti-racist
blind reaction to stress from ignorance anger and fear but affectionately counter-racist many
of these black men and their letters to me also have given me great encouragement support and help towards continuing our
fight for justice all black people are still in confinement forward this essay is not intended to be
sacrilegious or offensive to anyone i was baptized in the baptist church and christened
in the african methodist episcopal church this essay was written only to address the question black people have
been raising for a long time what's happening we ask that question of everyone that we meet because we truly have not
understood and presently do not understand what really is going on it is the responsibility of black behavioral
scientists in general and black psychiatrists in particular to provide this answer
the basic discussion of white genetic survival through the possession of control of the black male male's genital apparatus is carried
forth unconsciously in the precepts and practices of the global white supremacy system's primary religion christianity these
fundamental concepts are manifested in christianity's central pattern of symbols
in fact it is in religious activity that the highest level of symbolic discussion emerges
whereas the testicles are those aspects of the male anatomy that contain the dominant genetic material
the penis is the aspect that transports the genetic material which initiates the production of life
and skin color if one were to make a simple schematic drawing of the genital organs
of the male anatomy the diagram might look like diagram one a further abstraction of the same
drawing could be represented as diagram two or if further abstracted it could be
represented simply as two lines one vertical the other horizontal one crossing near the top of the other
it is clear that diagram three a highly abstracted line drawing of the male gen genitalia is a cross i submit that the cross as an
important and provocative symbol in the white supremacy system culture is none other than a brain computer
distillate of the white collective sphere induced obsession with the genitals of all non-white men
of black men in particular who have the potential to genetically annihilate the white race
furthermore the cross represents the male's genitals removed from the black male's body meaning castrated genitals thus the
cross is a critical symbol in the thought or process of the white supremacy system beginning its evolution almost two
thousand years ago during the early white aggression against blacks in africa and asia
this particular interpretation of the cross never has been given before support for this interpretation may be
found in the examination of the sword as a secondary critical symbol and a white supremacy culture
here i am referencing to the so-called western sword with its straight blade in contrast to the oriental sword which
has a curved blade j.e circlets a dictionary of symbols relating to the symbolism of the sword
states here one must recall the general meaning of weapons which is the antithesis of the monster in the
same discussion he notes there can be no doubt that there is a sociological factor in sword symbolism
since the sword is an instrument proper to the knight who is the defender of the forces of light against the forces of
darkness in a white supremacy system or culture the monster is always the black male
king kong and more specifically his white genetic annihilation genitals as the white male or the knight
moves to control the monster black male genitalia indeed he does become the defender of the forces of light against the forces of darkness
the western sword is shaped exactly as the cross the brain-computer distillate of the
male genitalia in an article entitled values myths and symbols which appeared in the july 1973
issue of the american journal of psychiatry ralom may had the following to say about the cross
for example the christian cross draws together the horizontal and vertical dimensions of life and unites them perpendicularly to each
other embracing their conflict however this is a superficial description of a cross and it is totally
inadequate as an in-depth interpretation of the symbol major symbol in the white supremacy
system culture the white collective scenes unable to decode their own symbolism completely
their own translations of the major symbols and their analysis of their unconscious remains superficial
incoherent and unconvincing therefore the white collective remains unaware of itself and unpredictable to
itself and to others who lack deep understanding if my interpretation of the cross symbol is correct
that in the white male psyche it represents the black male genitalia in the context of the global white supremacy system
then it is possible to understand the portrayal of the white female in a popular book and film the exorcist
here the female used the cross to masturbate herself when she was possessed by the devil i.e the black monster the symbolic
portrayal emerged during a time period in which increasing number of white met females were selecting black males as
mates or more correctly stated white females began sexually addressing against socially powerless black males
to gain position of the black phallus the use of the cross as a symbolic
object in white female masturbation also occurred when large numbers of white male like females
actively were fantasizing about being raped by black males and were establishing organizations and
societies to prevent it this was a reaction formation to their own unconscious desires
the white female's preoccupation with writing books on being raped also occurred during this time period in
white supremacy culture the historic symbol of the rapist of white females is the black male the
white female until recently has been held back in her sexual desires of the black male by white male constraint
since white female liberation has been granted to white women in small measure the white female finds
herself unable to hold her own desires and aggressions in check still she is unable to admit these desires and
aggressions consciously it is common knowledge that the ideal male for the white female is tall
dark and handsome interestingly following the exorcist the movie king kong became a major focus of attention
in 1976 the entire movie suggests an impending sexual attack on a white
family or white female by the giant black ape the symbol of black male finally
a black ape is shot dead by white males the gun is also a phallic symbol in the white supremacy culture
see chapter 8. at yet another level of the white supremacy cultural dynamic
white females jane goodall dianne fossey root gaudicas brenda moore and the role
of scientists are tracking or chasing down large black apes in the african and asian jungles
some of these white females actually have attempted to get very very close to these great black apes so that they can touch the apes and
perhaps unconsciously so that the great black apes can touch them it is a further interest that the above
mentioned films the exorcist and king kong simultaneously emerge in an atmosphere where increasing attention
had been given to christian symbolism and religion and during the period when the man who was elected to occupy the
white house referred to himself as a born-again christian making frequent references to christian
symbols and stricten scriptures that's the cultural stimulation thus the
cultural simultaneously focused on the threat black male genitals and the need to control the threat via castration of the
black genitals to cross symbol this discussion of the cross as a symbol of the black male genitalia in
the context of the white supremacy system culture would not be complete without noting that some of the most outspoken and
aggressive white male and female members of the white supremacy system refer to themselves as the ku klux klan
since the termination of formal enslavement of blacks the claim openly has espoused white genetic purity
and survival via the castration lynching and killing a black man the historic symbol for this group in
the white supremacy culture is the cross and more specifically the burning cross
after black men were lynched and castrated they often were burned thereby reinforcing the interpretation
that the cross symbolically is tied to the black male's genitalia and that the burning cross is burning black male and his genitals
when the black male genitalia with the dominant black jeans are burned cut off or otherwise destroyed white
genetic survival is assured constantine the roman emperor emperor
who ruled from 306 to 337 a.d built constantinople and made christian worship lawful
in the beginnings of the white supremacy culture had the following words placed on the cross in hawk signal vince's meaning
in his sign and this sign you will conquer indeed by controlling the black or
non-white male genitals which the cross symbolizes whites have conquered blacks and the entire
non-white world majority currently the majority membership of christian churches is non-white and all are held in control
under the sign of the cross the authority is maintained by whites under white supremacy white purity and
white survival more recently the fury of the white supremacy dynamic
was expressed in the form of nazism the dominant symbol used by this group in his white supremacy system
was and is the black swastika the central element of the swastika is the cross the spinning or whirling
cross to cross in motion gives the visual illusion of the swastika
hitler's and not hitler's in the nazi movement central's theme was white racial genetic purity and the
elimination of all persons classified as non-whites i.e semites and gypsies
who were viewed as having black genetic heritage from african who were considered genetically dominant to the aryans or whites
the symbol of the swastika the cross in motion spurred the whites on to destroy those who were classified as
genetically dominant non-whites to the extent that is can be accepted
that a man named jesus lived in africa some 2000 years ago and that he was a member of the indigenous peoples
that man was undoubtedly a black man a man with skin pigmentation not a white man lacking in
skin pigmentation albinism like leprosy causes the skin to turn white and was considered a serious disease in
ancient africa the victims of albinism and leprosy were cast out from the skin-pigmented peoples
jesus never was discussed as having such a diseased state recall that pigmented skin and his norm
for the human race not albinism in contrast to this black man and the black peoples of africa
the people on the northern side of the mediterranean sea some of whom referred to themselves as romans
were then aggressing against the establishing conquests in africa they were men without skin pigmentation
white men the most likely essence of the story of jesus who only later was referred to as
christ was that he was a poor black man a carpenter a member of the non-white oppressed
population whose ideas as expressed in the beutitudes threaten the power control and authority
of the conquering romans if jesus and the other blacks got out of control the romans or the whites could
be annihilated genetically of course then is now under white supremacy domination
jesus the non-white was turned over to the white oppressors who then used some of his fellow
victimized self-hating non-whites who wish to ingratiate themselves to the white oppressor to kill him jesus the black man was then
hung on a cross but a peculiar invention of the roman white psyche in other words
the white brain computer that feared annihilation by the black male genitals unconsciously invented an instrument or weapon of
black male destruction exactly in the abstract form analogous to the part of the black
male's anatomy the whites knew could destroy them jesus was not only hung on the cross
and stabbed but undoubtedly was also castrated in christian religious tradition it is
stated that jesus died on the cross and suffered so that we whites can be saved
survive white christian theology goes even further to speak of jesus
shedding his blood so that we whites can live and have everlasting life only in recent
years has genetic material ceased being referred to as blood always there has been and in some
circles it continues discussions about individuals having black blood or white blood when what was really meant
was black or genetic black or white genetic material or genes respectively
thus christian white supremacy theology can be translated as jesus a black man shed his black
genetic material and a crucifixion which in reality was a castration and a killing so that the white genetic
recessive population in fear of its genetic annihilation could be saved genetically survive thus
jesus is called savior by the whites it is little wonder that the holy day celebrated for the
death of jesus is referred to as good friday in a television series that represented a socially and
politically castrated black male similarly was referred to as good times the historically good
has had been a dead knicker and in keeping with this symbolic order there is a song
in a christian religion called nothing but the blood of jesus the chorus is as follows o precious is
the flow that makes me white as snow no other font i know nothing but the blood of jesus
this can be translated as as long as the genetic material for the black male is spilling on the ground from castration
whites can remain white as snow the pattern of worshipping and suffering dying jesus on the cross is fully
comprehended only when it is understood that jesus was a black man and that black wooden cross represents the black male genitalia separated from the man
only by the removal and destruction of the black male genitals can whites have everlasting life
in most fundamental genetic sense jesus of course had to be rationalized as willing to make this castration or
sacrifice giving up his genes so that whites might live there's a profound and striking
parallel between the above interpretation of the crucifixion and destruction of the black bulls with swords at bullfights
bullfighting became a prominent sport in spain after the moors black men finally had been chased out of
europe back across the mediterranean into africa the moors had conquered spain for
700 years and by the time they left the once white population had become
dark via the dominant black genetic material dark skin dark hair dark eyes
surlet's a dictionary of symbol states that the bull as an historic symbol represents the superiority of the aryan over the negro
this could not be possible this could not possibly be the logically correct meaning of the symbol if this analysis were
correct there would be no need for whites to kill a black bull with a sword obviously a more logical and accurate
interpretation of the bull symbol is the opposite of sterling's interpretation the bull represents the superiority or
genetic dominance of the blacks over the genetic recess of whites again the sword used to kill the black
bull as surlet also noted comes into play as the weapon of the forces of light over the forces of
darkness the sword signifies the weapon of the possessor of the white genitals or recessive white genetic material
against the dominant black genitals and their genetic material by the fourth century a.d
jesus had been changed in color from black jesus to white jesus then to be known as jesus christ or
simply christ this was the conscious and unconscious attempt to further repress from the collective white consciousness the true
source of white anxiety and fear the black male and his genitals instead of a lynch black jesus
a frail weak effeminate suffering and dying white christ was hung against the black wooden cross as a
dominant symbol in the religious practices of the white supremacy culture instead of the woolly kinky head of the
lamb of god there was the straight almost blonde hair of the white christ hung up against the black wooden cross
however this symbolic image achieved a more important goal in a single picture paragraph it states
the weak genetic recessive white male will be destroyed genetically speaking when up against the white annihilating
genetically dominant black male genital apparatus the cross honor toymbi
in mankind and mother earth states 15th century western christians were obsessed with the horror of death
the antithesis of the veronica egyptians pleasurable anticipation of a post-mortem eternity and they were fascinated by the
physical suffering of christ on the cross contemporary western painters and gravers and sculptors
especially in the trans transalpine countries extended their art to portray
these themes with gruesome realism the 15th century also heralded the europeans or the white's world travel to
conquer and control the entire non-white world in order to prevent white genetic annihilation and death
this horrendous fear was then translated in european art joel covel in his book white racism a
psycho history writes christianity spread over the west and created a community out of what has been
barbarian splinters it did this through the power of a concrete institution the catholic church it was the church's
immediate influence that held aloft a sublimatory ideal of christ and though that ideal
gave europeans a scaffold of identification with which to bind themselves into a unified civilization
men however remained men torn and driven by their obscure passions into striving for greed and domination which
culture could scarcely regulate intense aggression and resisted the church's unification
continued to plague european culture and delayed its growth within the original world view there was
no way to rationalize or include the striving for greed and domination that persisted within
civilization after all the christian revolution was superimposed upon a
basically diminutive way of life it could only account for the guilt that arose from
the dominative style of society by turning away from the given world
what kaaba fails to understand is that the fundamental reason catholic christianity from its early days of european organization and interpretation
of the jesus theology was able to unite the global white collective then the warring white tribes
of europe was because of the cross symbolism and a deep meaning it projected
when christianity projected the cross especially the cross with the limp pale body of christ hung on it everyone
in the global white collective unconsciously understood that they must unite against the threat of black
non-white male gen genital material which the black wooden cross represented
white genetic survival could be achieved only by a united continuous offensive attack by the global white minority this
organized attack is now at least two thousand years old the greed and the strivings for domination
which kavo fails to fully understand were com compensation for profound sense of
genetic inadequacy only in this context of symbol
translation can a christian hymn onward christian soldier be appreciated this is not the not only an important
religious song but also a significant battle song in a white supremacy culture one stanza the song is as follows onward
christian soldier marching as to war with the cross of jesus going on before
christ our loyal master leads against the foe forward into battle see his banners glow chorus honored
christian soldier marching as to war with the cross of jesus going on before
my translation in prose of the above words and symbol images in this song is onward white male and
white female soldiers marching to war to establish and maintain white genetic survival
you have the symbol of the black male genitals before you keeping your true purpose in mind so that you can unite to subdue this
common thread christ the white male image is your loyal master who is leading you in the attack against
the black male genital monster enemy the white male leads you into battle behind our glowing flags
phallic symbols with the picture of a dying weak white man held firmly in mind white
people fully understood that they must prevent from occurring and why they must fight and if necessary
die so that whites can survive onward christian soldier is a marching religious song for the white
supremacy culture but were you there when they crucified my lord and stark contrast is a song of deep
pain and sorrow about the castration and destruction of the black male by the marching white supremacy army
or its individual stormtroopers in modern times the gun has become a contemporary symbol
symbolic weapon used against a non-white male and his white annihilating genetic potential also the gun is an
abstraction of the male genitalia functioning exactly like the male genital apparatus see chapter 8. thus it is no accident
that dr martin luther king jr the modern day jesus was killed by a gun after being brought into focus on the
cross of the crosshairs on a telescopic gun site dr king brought
only love to the white collective but mating love black with white causes
white genetic annihilation so he had to be destroyed
the communion since the 16th century protestants believe that the act of
communion is a symbolic reenactment of the crucifixion with the bread and wine becoming the body and the
blood of jesus the christian worshipping injustice bread and wine as an act to remove sin
not to internalize divinity the orthodox christian believed that the communion was a spiritual act that could not be
explained in august 1976 the catholic church the orthodox christians and the protestants came together
and agreed that the communion or the eucharist conveys christ's real presence and represents his
sacrifice giving up of his body and blood although it is not to be viewed as an actual
reenactment of crucifixion the author's analysis of the symbolism of the communion in the context of the
white supremacy culture in which it evolved reveals that the white population has had a
historic awareness albeit now largely unconscious that they suffered bodily or genetic
impairment which made them different and separated from the human majority of black
brown red and yellow people they were not alone not whole the same genetic deficiency was the
basis for the consideration of original sin and the shame of body nakedness
body whiteness as discussed as the biblical mythology of adam and eve an important myth in the white supremacy
culture the view that the act of sex was the original sin in an extension is the same
logic because the sex act produces the body and its appearance via genetic transfer
and or genetic mutation having rejected the appearance of the white body as the equivalent of sin
and shame the white psyche attempted to correct the white body's defect emerged a symbolic and
ritualized act of ingesting the body and blood or genes of jesus the black male
any unconscious desire to correct the existing color deficiency the symbolic attempt to correct the
genetic deficiency state of skin albinism or skin whiteness as performed in the eucharist
is the central religious rite and religion of the white supremacy system culture therefore it is not surprising that
wearing black or dark color clothing generally covering the entire body is the primary most acceptable pattern of
dress for christian religious leaders priests ministers nuns etc one finds
curious to overdetermine highly intense abhorrence that many in the white collective continue to verbalize over the idea of cannibalism
always relating acts of cannibalism to so-called primitive blacks in africa this continuing discussion is most
interesting behavior on the part of the whole those who symbolically practice cannibalism
an essential right of their own religious practice on a weekly or monthly basis even more significant
is the fact that the blacks are portrayed as eating missionaries or christians when it is the christians who always are
constantly concerning themselves with their own ingesting of the body and blood of an african jesus
this is a classic example of projection reinforcement for this interpretation of
the communion symbolism comes not only from the white's obsessive pattern of sun tanning to make their bodies colored but also
from major eating practices in the white supremacy culture especially in the u.s the most favored drinks are all dark
brown in color coffee tea coke beer whiskey these are all symbolic of the blood or
genes of jesus a favorite meat is steak which comes from the bull or
cattle we need not mention the hot dogs have smokes or all the other varieties
of sausage also are not bulls castrated to make them taste better when eaten
are not football players fed steak before they attempt to go out and capture the large brown balls
i further understand that bull balls are eaten as delicacies in some bars and other eating establishments in the white
supremacy culture the favorite candy is chocolate candy chocolate comes mainly from africa
preferably with nuts recall chocolate kisses and all the mirrored chocolate candy bars nuts are
also important in the white supremacy culture some have focused on peanuts and
and become millionaires and the most powerful persons in the world
finally given the symbolism behind such eating practices it follows that oral sexual practices would be a
favorite in the white supremacy system culture likewise the symbolism in the major
holidays of the christian religion is supportive of my interpretations at christmas the tree is one of the most
important symbols the christmas tree is in its abstracted form across
the symbol of the black male genitals first the christmas tree is chopped down in the forest that is taken home
and in the u.s when the christmas tree is decorated or colored balls are hung on the tree when
a tree is taken down and burned the balls are first taken off then all can dream of a white christmas and a
surviving white christ similarly in europe small white wax
candles were placed on a christmas tree and the catholic religion the christmas tree is said to represent the tree of
the cross while the wax candles are thought to represent the body of christ thus again we have the symbol of the
white week melting christ hung on the symbol of the black male genitalia at the easter holiday in the u.s it is
tradition to have colored eggs colored jelly beans and a chocolate rabbit and eggs in the easter basket
these colored items are eaten the white albino bunny rabbit that sits amongst the colored eggs as
though he had laid them generally is not eaten by ingesting the colored items the sin of being without color is symbolically
removed being born again whole has been achieved through symbols
other important holidays in the white supremacy culture further reveal the intricate workings of this symbolism
on both saint valentine's day and mother's day the white male gives gifts of chocolate candy with nuts
in the first instance he gives it to his sweetheart and in a second to his mother if his sweetheart and just chocolate
with nuts the white male can fantasize that he is genetically equal to the black male and if this
mother had ingested chocolate with nuts he would not have to worry about white genetic annihilation
as he would have been colored and then could be an annihilator of white jeans like
the feared and envied black male both the valentine's shape and chocolate
candy have a symbolic meaning not previously recognized examined nor understood by western culture
investigators however once the unified field of the western culture dynamic or behavior dynamic is
set forth it will be seen that these fragments and symbolism take on brilliant clarity
the encyclopedia britannica defines valentine's as a special form of greeting card
exchange and observance of saint valentine's day february 14th a day set aside as a lover's festival
the custom has no connection with the two saint valentines or with known incidents in their lives it's probably
that the valentine was the first of all greeting cards the paper valentine dates from the 16th century
by 1800 hand-painted copper plates were produced to meet large demands
these were followed by wood cuts and lithograms same valentine's day as a lover's festival and the modern
tradition of sending valentine cards had no relation to the saint but rather seem to be connected with either the roman fertility festival
of the lupercalia february 15th or with the mating season of birds
the relationship of the valentine to an ancient fertility rite suggests that the so-called heart shape
of the valentine may be less associated with the anatomical heart of the human body as it is commonly thought than with the
symbolic drawing of the female gender genital organ the vagina the vaginal opening as
explained in ajit mukuji's and mandu kana's the tantric way
in tantric worship in india this organ is frequently drawn in the form of a heart or an
upside down triangle with the base upward it is clear that the organ of the heart and the human
body has much less in association with fertility than the vagina or the vaginal
orifice circulate states the importance of love and the mystic doctrine of unity
explains how it is that love symbolism can be closely linked with heart symbolism for the love
is only to experience a force that urges the lover towards a given center indeed in that tantric philosophy and
art symbol symbol of unity was the union of the male and female genital organs and this unity was reverently portrayed
in sculpture and graphic arts an explanation of the symbolism of chocolate in western
culture will expose further the significance of heart-shaped valentines as well as the importance of chocolate
in an article entitled the sweet taste of sin marion burroughs quotes food critic gail
green i have always thought of chocolate good chocolate mousse as an aphrodisiac
the more intense the taste of chocolate the more erotic to spell merriam burrows continues some chocolate
mousse lovers go even further it's not a food it's a concept says one indulgent male
it's like illicit sex it's so good but so fattening it gives you pimples it's a
sin burrows concludes quoting gail green wonderful wicked deeply chocolate one
can certainly must question why in a culture produced by a people that refers to itself as the white race
and historically has denounced people with natural chocolate complexions a dark brown food namely chocolate
causes such orgasms like ecstasy and is associated with eroticism when orally ingested
this pattern of logic and thought surrounding chocolate dark brown candy and other desserts most certainly cannot be held in
isolation from the previously mentioned preoccupations over sun tanning and the white female preference for
males who are tall and dark or the preoccupation in sports of placing large brown balls
testicle symbols and white nets vaginal orifices in between goal posts white upright legs
the unified field theory in the behavioral science demands that gross and subtle interconnections between behavioral
phenomenon be perceived before they can be understood that there should be a myriad behaviors
in the white supremacy behavior system that reflect the deep desire to counteract and compensate for
the perceived genetic deficiency of white skin should not be at all surprising thus the
customary and traditional little packets of chocolate candy often with nuts placed inside of the heart or
vaginal orifice shaped box are like little sperm packages of black genetic material being placed in the vaginal
orifice when presented by the white male to the white female in the context of skin
color deficient culture the act is the exact parallel to the white male coaches who
coach their black basketball and football players to place dark brown balls in the white net orifices or in
white upright legs one must conclude that the white male realizes consciously or
unconsciously that the most desired mate for the white female is the black male just says he realizes
that his most desired sexual mate is the black female this illuminates the white male's fascination
with black stockings black underwear black negligees as sexual symbols
conclusions the conscious and or unconscious acceptance and internalization of a symbol's
system based upon a castrated black male genitalia is essential to the global system of white genetic survival
the symbol system necessitates the oppression of blacks and all of the non-whites in the global context of
white supremacy generally the victims of a system of oppression have no alternative other
than to accept blindly the patterns of symbols logic thought speech emotional responses
and perceptions that are imposed forcefully upon them by their oppressors after hundreds of years of oppression
the oppressed having lost a sense of their own identity begin to believe that the brain products of the oppressors are one and the same
with their own failing completely to realize that they do not control their own brain computers nor
their brain computer's output the slave's fate is not seeing not to see nor reason why but only to
die to do or die however the process of liberation is one where in the oppressed
begins to clearly distinguish their perceptions logic and thought process from the oppressors the
oppressed then begin to respect and validate their perceptions and their logic and thought processes
realizing fully that they can never free themselves with the thought process and perceptions that
were part of the process of their enslavement as long as the black non-white collective consciously and or
unconsciously accept a powerful and dynamic symbolism of black male castration they never will be a
self-group respecting and forever will remain mentally ill mentally ill people persons
who do not respect themselves and have self group negating patterns of logic thought speech action emotional response
and perceptions never can liberate themselves from their oppressors black psychiatrists have the
responsibility of clarifying for black people all aspects of the oppressive dynamic of white genetic survival
this includes exposing and decoding all of that power system major symbolism
Chapter 6 - PAGES 81-92
the isis papers chapter six the politics behind black male passivity feminization by sexuality and
homosexuality black male passivity of feminization by sexuality and homosexuality are being
encountered increasingly by black psychiatrists working with black patient populations these issues are being presented by
family members personnel working in schools and other social institutions or by black men themselves
men in the black population are reaching the conclusion that such issues have become a problem of epidemic proportion
amongst black people in the u.s although it was an almost non-existent behavioral phenomenon amongst indigenous
plaques in africa as black psychiatrists and behavioral scientists we need to understand fully the
individual and social dynamics involved in these patterns of behavior we must be able to help our patients
understand their conduct and change it if they so desire also we should be in a position to comment on the ultimate implications of
these behaviors for the well-being of black people not simply as individuals but as a whole organism of people seeking life and
maximal development and final analysis behavior is not simply an individual affair
for when multiplied by thousands it has a profound effect on the life future existence and well-being of the
total people in 1973 i presented my definition of black mental health
the practice of those unit patterns of behavior i.e logic thought speech action emotional response in all areas of people activity
economics education entertainment labor law politics religion sex and war which is simultaneously self and group
supporting under the social and political conditions of worldwide white supremacy domination or racism in brief this means black
behavioral practice which resists self and group negation and destruction
the above are the criteria used to judge black mental health or black mental illness the reader
should be forewarned that my conceptualizations do not rely on the currently utilized late 19th and early
century 20th century european psychoanalytic theories of sigmund freud if freud's insights into behavior were
truly adequate they would have aided his 6 million fellow semites in preventing their destruction by the anti-semitic white
supremacy power organization of nazi germany failing to understand this major
behavioral dynamic freud had to flee to his to save his life furthermore my conceptualizations do not
rely on a recent position taken by the american psychiatric association that homosexuality is no longer
categorized as a form of behavioral illness this pronouncement has nothing to do with the mental health of black people
the human brain the organ responsible for all patterns of logic thought speech action and emotional response is an
organ of the nervous system that evolved over many thousands of years its purpose has been to decode and solve
problems in the external environment both its physical and social aspects the
specific patterns of behavior may be looked upon as functional or dysfunctional solutions to the problems
posed by the external environment when the brain's purpose is understood
patterns of male passivity feminization bisexuality and homosexual may be looked upon
as functional or dysfunctional solutions to specific problems posed in the environment even though consciously they are not
understood as such but for what environmental problems are these behaviors considered answers
functional or dysfunctional and for whom these questions cannot be answered without first understanding the nature
of the environment the specific dynamic and structure of the social system in which these behaviors occur
as explained in chapter one racism white supremacy is the dominant social system in today's
world its fundamental dynamic is predicated upon a genetic recessive deficiency state of albinism
which is responsible for the skin whiteness and the so-called white race this genetic recessive trait is
dominated by the genetic capacity to produce any of the various degrees of skin melanation
whether black brown red or yellow in other words it can be annihilated as a phenotypic
condition control of this potential for genetic domination and annihilation throughout the world
is absolutely essential if the condition of skin whiteness is to survive white survival is predicated upon
aggressiveness and muscle mass in the form of technology directed against the non-white melanated men on planet earth
who constitute the numerical majority therefore white survival and white power
are dependent upon the various methodologies tactics and strategies developed to control all non-white men
as well as to bring them into cooperative submission this is especially important in the case of black men because they have the
greatest capacity to produce melanin and in turn the greatest genetic potential for the annihilation of skin
albinism or skin whiteness during the past 400 years black men in the us have been forced
into passive and cooperative submission to white men the major strategy has been the installation of an overwhelming fear
specific tactics range from the actual physical castration and lynching to other overt and more
subtle forms of abuse violence and cruelty we should not be ashamed to recognize the
these tactics used to oppress black men it is the truth it is reality ultimately is the meaning
of black oppression all black people are oppressed i emphasize here that black men are
oppressed because ultimately it is male muscle mass the depressed is a people and only male muscle mass has the
potential for achieving liberation if the men of a people are oppressed the women are brought under
oppression as they are dependent on the men for protection and defense women do not have the muscle
mass to liberate the people and protect the young women develop the young but their men must provide the protection
and the security apparatus the global white male collective understands the priority of white domination they fully
understand consciously or unconsciously the threat that black men represent to them
also white males realize that in the final analysis the vast majority of females must submit to males because of
their lesser muscle mass additionally white males fully understand the males who are forced to
identify as females will be programmed simultaneously into submission to the males they call the man as
opposed to aggressing against those same men white men in this world area have at least a vague perhaps
unconscious understanding that after 20 generations 400 years male passivity has evolved into male feminization
bisexuality and homosexuality these patterns of behavior are simply expressions of male self-submission to other males in the
area of people activity called sex males also can submit to males in
any of the other eight areas of people activity economics education entertainment labor law politics religion and war
oppression is forced submission and cooperation in any of the areas of people activity
however the white male arrives at this deeply repressed sense of femininity because not only can he be
dominated genetically by all black and other men of color but more profound from the white male
perspective is the fact that he is dominated genetically by all black and other non-white females
for the offspring of a white male and non-white female will be non-white like like their mother
rather than white like their father thus the offspring are genetically dominant in respect to the white male
this sense of genetic weakness when compared to the majority of the world's women propels the white male to project
weakness passivity of feminization by sexuality and homosexuality onto the black male which is his arch
potential challenger furthermore the white male collective structures the social environment
to transfer this mental protection into a functional reality the more the black male strives to stand
the weaker the white male feels by comparison and the greater the white male's thrust to feminize the black male
the weaker the black male's psychological potential for aggressive and assertive challenge forcing him to
remain submissive to the man the american psychiatric association's decision to remove
homosexuality from the list of mental or behavioral disturbances resulted from the increasing number of
white males seeking this mode of sexual expression due to an increasing consciousness of true white male weakness
male bisexuality and homosexuality can be viewed as the sexual expression of male weakness passivity and feminization
the motivation for these feelings and their sexual expression results primarily from the developing challenge
by non-white men throughout the world to white male power and projected superiority these
challenges assume various subtle and overt forms during recent decades
for example in a u.s heavyweight boxing basketball baseball and football have all been taken away from white
males by black males as symbolic expressions of white male virility and manhood
white males have been left with only two major sports wherein they dominate tennis and golf and both consist of
hitting small white balls i did not only mention that black men have been blocked effectively from
participating in these remaining white stronghold sports it is also crushing to the white to the
collective white male ego and sense of power to be told by colored men called arabs that the whites cannot have
any oil to run their machines and maintain and extend their technology their major control apparatus
increasingly the white male is being forced to see himself as he really is the white female's liberation movement
is another disturbing threat to the white male's sense of power and masculinity helping to push him to a weakened and homosexual stance
however white females are reacting to the oppression imposed on them by white males feeling inferior to non-white
males and females the white male said to the white female well at least i am going to be superior
to you the white female reaction in the form of women's liberation is contributing further
to white male female alienation pushing white males further into the homosexual position
and incidentally pushing white females in that direction also the long-standing white male female
alien nation in a white family has pushed a white female perhaps unconsciously to mold her sons to be more like herself
than like their father thus she creates a female with a penis additionally she proceeds
to fight back at the male and finally achieves symbolically a penis for herself resolving a white female's
penis envy complex a compensation for her sense of inferiority imposed by men
in a similar way she fights back at the white male when she captures a black male's penis and taunts the white male
who believes her black penis is stronger than his own from another perspective white male and
female homosexuality can be viewed as the final expression of their dislike of their genetic albinism in a world
numerically dominated by colored people this dislike of their appearance through deeply repressed
causes of negation of the act of self-reproduction sex in various forms this is the eventual
origin of the home of homosexuality is a parallel activity to all familiar discussions of population
zero and birth control now current articulations in the white supremacy culture
all the aforementioned dynamics are components of the total dynamic of racism
some of the metallic methodologies used to achieve black male submission or feminization warrant further examination unlike the
white male the black male does not arrive at the effeminate by sexual or homosexual stance from any
deeply repressed sense of genetic weakness inadequacy or disgust which i prefer referred to as primary
effeminacy the femininity that is self-derived and not imposed forcibly by others
instead the black male arrives at this position secondarily as a result of the imposed power and cruelty of the white male and the
totality of the white supremacy social and political apparatus that has forced 20 generations of black males into
submission this pattern of imposed submission is reinforced through every institution
within the white supremacy system but especially in the fundamental social institutions or the family or in this case the black
survival unit i make the distinction and terminology between family and survival unit because
the family by definition is a social institution that functions to support maximal development and protection of
the young however under white supremacy blacks and other non-whites are not to be
developed maximally they are permitted to survive as functional inferiors alienated from self
and from their own kind the non-white survival unit is not permitted to defend itself or its young
the survival the survival unit functions accordingly the imposed internal dynamics of the
survival unit as within the racist system in general functions function to negate black manhood as
fundamentally expressed in the relationship between breadwinning and true power potential
even when high level income is allowed there is no true power in its ultimate sense meaning to support protect and
defend the lives of oneself one's wife and one's children under any serious system of oppression this riot is denied
an oppressed male and with this denial there is a concomitant and proportionate loss of
respect for manhood in the oppressed population this attitude begins first within the
oppressed man himself and radiates to all of the members of the survival unit this result in frustration of black
manhood potential a pressure and grievance that cannot be redressed directly at its source under
fear of death forces behavior into dysfunctional non-satisfying circular obsessive
compulsive patterns in areas of people activity where greater degrees of maleness are permitted to be expressed i.e sex
sports and entertainment under the white supremacy slavery system the identity of sex machines was imposed
upon black males especially as many hands were needed in the fields for toil and labor the many babies that were
produced gave black males their most open avenue for at least a limited sense of manhood presently within with the birth
control pills and with the pressure for population zero for all non-whites this major male ego support
also has been taken away without jobs income power or even babies there is no
proof of sexual functioning when this reality is coupled with the awareness that many women can receive
more from a welfare check than they can from their male partners the reason for women respecting men and
staying with them steadily declined and black male female alienation increases recent statistics revealed
that today 1974 thirty four percent of black families are headed by females as
compared to ten percent of white families and this figure is increasing each year
in the metropolitan area of washington dc there are sixty one thousand black male children growing up in homes
without their fathers or other father surrogates while 90 of their teachers in the public schools are
also females this produces a massive deficiency in adult male males for role modeling and imprinting
such male role modeling and imprinting are essential for black male children to understand adult male role
functioning as black males and females become more and more alienated as the current rates of separation and
divorce indicate and as black females are being left to rear black male children alone the alienation
hate and disgust towards adult males are visited upon their sun subtly a female alienated from males is
hard-pressed to reinforce patterns of conduct in a man child that remind her
of unhappiness and pain she's much more inclined to say there you go looking and acting like no
good father of yours the black female teacher at school who also may be experiencing alienation from
her black man if not inclined to make the same statement in such a direct manner only says it
more subtly says nothing or simply acts out of her hate disgust and just distrust the black
males achieving the same end result it is little wonder that 98 of all of the black male children i talk
with who have reached the junior high level hate school schools and their personnel like
all of the aspects of the racist system do not share do their share to alienate black males
for maximal functioning and thus further the ultimate alienation of black males from themselves and their
manhood as a result of this pattern of socialization black males soon learned that it is easier to be a female child
than the male child and more promising to be an adult black female than an adult black male in childhood
male children learn whether at home or at school that they can make mothers and female teachers happy and they will
shower you with smiles and affection when they act like females rather than like boys
the dearth of adult black males in the homes schools and neighborhoods leaves black male children no
alternative models blindly they seek out one another as models and then their blindness end up in trouble
in juvenile homes or prisons but fate in the dynamics of racism again play a vicious trick
because the young males only become more alienated from their manhood and more feminized in such settings they
are given orders by men to whom they must submit they wait passively to be fed three meals a day by
men and finally they have sexual intercourse with men it is no wonder that they are unable to
play the role of black men when they leave one ex-prisoner patient prisoner patient
told me it's easier to endure the life on the inside than to try to put up with the pressures of being a man
a husband and a father in the street the intent of racist programming had been achieved give up trying to be a black
man why not be a woman many black males have answered unconsciously
why not the braided and curled hair the earrings the braces the midriff tops the cinch-wasted pants the flowered
underwear the high-heeled shoes with platforms in the pocketbook's all behavior answers to the above they
say in loud and clear language white man i will never come after you i cannot run in my high heels and you know
that and i mess up my hair the white run clothing industry is all too pleased to provide the costumes of feminine
disguise for blackmail escape however they never would provide uniforms of count or combat gear if
customers were willing to pay 1 000 an outfit television which has become an
important programmer of behavior in the social system and culture plays a further major role in alienating
black males especially children from black manhood flip wilson the highest paid black male
on television maintains his high ratings by dressing in great detail as a tough and coarse black female
one of my seven-year-old black male patients told me my mommy likes geraldine and i think geraldine is cute good times
the latest media affairs for indoctrinating the black oppressed shows a pitiful adult black male who
never can seem to find an adequate job in a black adolescent male who is criminal shoplifter and a complete clown
all of this takes place in the presence of a strong and powerful black female who periodically drops down on her knees
to pray to a white jesus whose miracles save the situation
these weekly insults to black manhood that we have been programmed to believe are entertainment and not direct racist warfare further
reinforced perhaps in the unconscious thinking of black people a loss of respect for black manhood
while carrying that loss to even deeper levels one twelve-year-old black male summed it up in this manner when i questioned him
about working hard and studying in school no i do not want to study so i can help black people
if you try to help black people you'll be killed look at martin luther king malcolm x and george jackson i don't want to die
this reality of white supremacy oppression must be approached either linearly head-on or with a
circular pattern of behavior to escape this horrendous reality of death sex having been granted as the one
though limited area within black males could express manhood became the area of behavior where circular patterns or
escape were acted out symbolically speaking attempts were made to hide in a dark black vaginal orifice
when that closed down the white vaginal orifice was tried when that also proved unsatisfactory as
a hiding place or passage to freedom black and white male anuses were tried
or one might say these became the hope for undercover railroads to freedom
the underground railroad has escaped from the white man no longer being operative because black men are forced into
patterns of both conscious and unconscious logic ever increasing incidence of black male passivity a feminization bisexuality and
homosexuality can be understood logically and accurately predicted there is only
one solution the black males collectively face the horrendous presence of white males and conquer the accompanying fear engendered
by his act after the white man is faced he must be resisted steadfastly
and fought if he continues to wage war on black people as he has demonstrated historically that he intends to do
and it is black males and not females who must do the fighting black male homosexuality and bisexuality
are only the long run by products byproducts of males submitting in fear to other males in the social arena
they fail to resist because death is the result of resistance the large number of black male homosexuals and bisexuals report that
they had been had and have little or no respect for their fathers might have had a completely different
life histories had they grown up with the knowledge that their fathers died while in defense of their manhood when it was attacked
and challenged by the oppressor this is especially true if the mothers also admired and respected the father's
manhood then manhood would have been viewed as something so precious that one dies in
defense of it this is quite different input into the child's brain computer than he was a no good trifling lazy
and you shouldn't never want to be like him but the social political dynamic of racism itself predicated upon a white
male's alienation from his own genetic status should in turn cause others to be alienated from their own genetic status
determining color or sexual orientation should not cause surprise it should put the victims of such a
dynamic on the alert so that they efficiently and effectively can counter this destructive assault against the appreciation of their own
total genetic status all black children should be protected by black people
from being alienated against any of their genes by those genes of color sexual gender or
sickle cell anemia racists will attempt to bring about such a genetic annihilation
or alienation but black people should be prepared to counter her
black psychiatrists must understand that whites may condone homosexuality for themselves but we as blacks must see it as a
strategy for destroying black people that must be countered homosexuals or bisexuals should neither be condemned
nor degraded as it did not decide that they would be so programmed in childhood the racist system should be held
responsible a task is to treat and prevent its continuing and increasing occurrence
one method i have been using with all black male patients whether their particular disorder be passivity
or feminization bisexuality homosexuality or other is to have them relax envision
themselves approaching and opposing in actual combat the collective of white males
and females without apology or giving up in the crunch the fear of such a confrontation is at
the basis of most of today's black male pathologies in patterns of logic thought speech
action and emotional response as they participate in all areas of human activity i've been working with black mothers and
black male children attempting to help them rid themselves of the fear of their sons and their father and their men dying
which pushes them unconsciously to make babies of their sons and their husbands in an effort to try to protect and defend them
this response is the exact reverse of what is needed under the conditions of racism black women must learn to rear sons who
will learn from the cradle that their major function as men is not to get a job and a fine car
but to defend protect and support their people in that order even should death be the
consequence that the black male is not a sex machine but a protector and developer of black people
must be learned during the rearing process there will be good jobs and self-respect if not find cars once the people are
liberated there will be no true self-respect until the task is complete as a people we will need
increasingly strong men because we can expect that white males driven into homosexuality from their sense of
weakness compared to the world's majority of colored men also will move towards others non-whites
which is always an attempt to compensate for the awareness of true weakness black male bisexuality
and homosexuality has been used by the white collective in its efforts to survive genetically
in a world dominated by colored people and black acceptance of this imposition does not solve the major problem of our
oppression but only further retards its ultimate solution
Chapter 7 - PAGES 93-102
the isis papers chapter seven what freud was really talking about the concept of penis envy every social
system including its reflected culture has a priority objective whether that objective is articulated clearly or
disguised hypocritically in the final analysis a social system is a behavior system consisting of
specifically designed patterns of behavior patterns of logic thought speech action and
emotional response structured both consciously and unconsciously which are used as social
tools to achieve the priority objective of a people these behavior patterns are carried
forth in all areas of people activity economics education entertainment labor law politics religion
sex and war white supremacy is the single priority objective of the world's dominant social system
the system has been functioning for the past several hundred years and discussing the psychogenetic motivations
for the white supremacy systems origin in chapter one i fully realize how presumptuous it may seem to
some in the context of white supremacy system culture that i a black female psychiatrist should
presume to critique the thinking of sigmund freud one of the acknowledged major thinkers of the white supremacy system
however having been taught and having read freudian theory i decided long ago that most of freud's
analysis made little if any real sense after studying history and carefully analyzing what i see happening about me
daily i've concluded that i have every right indeed every obligation and responsibility
as a being on this planet to set forth my thinking on a furore that has been made on the
subject of freud's work and thought if i should need further justification for my activity
i offer the following for whatever it's worth many white psychiatrists already are concluding
and stating aloud that their psychiatry is dead psychiatry that for the past 50 years has been based on freudian theses
apparently that are recognizing from experience that the theory has little practical use and two if sigmund ford was really an
astute behavioral analyst and scientist why was he unable to decode or predict the behavior of those in the environment
in which he as a jew found himself an environment in which a full one-third of the world's total
jewish population would be destroyed certainly if freud was a jew was going to spend most of his energy thinking
about and decoding behavior he should have thought it greatest detail about why his people semites historically had been under
attack throughout the whole of their eu appearing existence that ford should tell others what to do with their behavior while he failed to
provide answers for himself and for his entire group suggested one can only take his ideas with the proverbial grain of salt
but as i demonstrate floyd perhaps feebly and unconsciously were struggling to discuss the major issue of
his existence as an oppressed non-white victim in a white supremacy culture therefore his discussion coming forth in
the language of abstraction and displacement has remained completely obscure and in a final analysis useless
it is my view for the word semite is derived right from the latin prefix semi which means half semi to the jewish
religion are persons from africa who were half black and half white black plus white always equals colored
meaning persons carrying in a genetic make up some capacity to produce melanin pigmentation and in some instances a genetic capacity
to produce kinky hair jews who left africa and went to europe were colored people
when they arrived there hundreds of years ago europeans or whites never have forgotten the
semite capacity for genetic dominance of the aryan white population although after much into mixing many
jews lost much of their color they have continued to be identified as a colored people from the aft from
africa by the whites this is the fundamental reason for the historic oppression of semites within the white
supremacy system culture hitler articulated his most clearly when on the one hand he
insisted the jews were genetically inferior to the aryans but on the other hand he continued to speak of the genetic dominance over the
aryans or whites freud could not focus fully on this because he desired acceptance in the
white supremacy culture and did not want his science of psychoanal analysis looked upon as a jewish degraded science
thus he could not come to terms with his own identity nor the dynamic affecting those so identified by the surrounding
social system instead of focusing on a dynamic of self-repression a very convenient
displacement for the brain computer that has a natural uninterrupted linkage between sex and self as sex is the act responsible
for the existence of the self and the only act through which the self could be reproduced
as a semite freud found himself focusing on sex oppression sex oppression indeed did occur in white
supremacy culture as demonstrated by the historic alien nation from the condition of albinism and the act of original sin or
sex which is viewed as responsible for the appearance of whiteness in a world of colored people
my concentration here is a topic of penis envy and a major cornerstone of freudian
edifice in other chapters i discussed the edible
complex and castration anxiety in brief according to freudian
psychological theory the little white girl is struck with an intense sense of loss
and injury with envy of the white male when she realizes that her clitoris is an inferior organ to the male's
penis wishing that she too had such a fine penis presumably she is not satisfied until
she has a penis of her own or symbolic form of a penis a major segment of the male females
personality is presumed to be predicated on this traumatic realization as previously mentioned freud was a
semitic victim in a white supremacy culture and a culture that had its true genesis not in greece but in africa the first
albino mutations whites were produced from blacks in africa these albinos i suggest were chased
north by the blacks or wandered north from the intense sun so that they could survive
see chapter two they ended their trek in europe directly north of africa
from the very first experiences of the mutant albino population with the recognition that the condition of skin albinism or whiteness could be
annihilated genetically by those with black and brown skins a phenomenon that is now known as
genetic dominance over a genetic recessive state such as albinism there had been a white fear of black
genetic power of white male fear and envy of the black penis or phallus and entire genital apparatus this fear
in turn produced a sense of inadequacy and inferiority in the white male as it compared himself to males of color
the total group's conscious or unconscious awareness of the genetic weakness and potential annihilation became even more pronounced
as a culture theme as europeans or whites began circumnavigating the globe in the 15th
century and on at this time whites discovered that there were a tiny minority on a planet wherein all others had colored skins
i did not take long for the group it did not take long for the group to realize that both colored males and females could annihilate the whites genetically
thus the white male felt genetically weaker not only in comparison to the black male but also to the black female black male had to be
feared more because it is males who initiate the act of reproduction the above genetic dynamics are of course
never discussed directly and overtly within the white supremacy system culture most overt discussions on genetics
center around analysis of the inferiority of black and other non-white people which of course is a projective compensation
the full discussion however that continues covertly and unconsciously permeates the logic sequences within the
culture now perhaps it would be fair to state that the true awareness of the fundamental genetic issue
is repressed white envy of the black phallus is addressed unconsciously when whites constantly concern
themselves with the comparative size of the black phallus versus the size of the white phallus this concern is raised in the form of
the following question is the black male's penis really greater in size than that of white male
any school child could suggest that a simple tape measure can settle the question once and for all
unless the questioners and researchers are afraid to measure in my practice the black mother informed
me that her six-year-old son attending a predominantly whites elementary school reported to her that one of his white male classmates had told him that he
the black child had a large penis the mother stated that she asked her son what his response was her son told the
white boy that all black boys had large penises it is obvious that in an above situation
in a school with the majority of white children at shower or bathroom time the white male child would have had
ample opportunity to see the size of the white penises he would have had the same opportunity
at home his need to comment on the size of the black child's penis indicates that the black penis must have stood out
by all other comparisons even at this tender age it is also certainly clear that the
black male child had no concerns or fears about the adequacy of the black male's penis furthermore it is my interpretation the
major concern is with the power of the genetic material in the black testicles and that concern is displaced to a less
threatening object the phallus and its size to appreciate my analysis remember that the major percentage of
black males who have been lynched by white males have had their genitals attacked removed and taken away by white males i
carried with them on their person this behavior is peculiar to white males in the relationship to men of color i interpret
this behavior as fear of the black male genitalia thus it must be attacked and destroyed but also there is envy and a desire for
possession of sane this should help to explain why white males who wish others to view them
or wish to view themselves as strong powerful and important puff and suck on huge black cigars
indeed the more important they wish others to believe they are the longer the cigar perhaps the foul loader is the draw of
attention of others to themselves with their long black cigars their symbolic phallus
also the more powerful and important a white male perceives himself the longer is is black limousine both
the car and cigar can be viewed as phallic symbols perhaps black and dark brown pipes also
should be included as similar symbols it is again little wonder that white men build missiles shaped in the form of
phalluses painted them white and used them to annihilate peoples of color around the globe i've said all the above
to state this yes there is penis envy in the white supremacy culture but it began with the white male's envy
of the genetic power residing in blackmail's testicles and phalluses perhaps there is also envy of a
comparative longer length of the black phallus the sense of his relative genetic weakness or inferiority compared to
black males because black is always genetically dominant to white
caused the white male to attempt to project inferiority on white females as well see chapter six
the white male's insistence that he is superior to the white female and is forcing his psychological dynamic and
white family life has caused the white female in turn to wish that she could share his power
and his status and symbolically to have a penis of her own the extent to which white females as mothers play a
role in helping to turn their sons into effeminate homosexuals female acting men with penises is again
an attempt to resolve an aspect of the conflict now some white females react to this imposed
sense of their genitalia inferiority to seeking to liberate themselves and secure black penises of their own
penises while males consider more powerful than their own this is the dialogue that increasing
numbers of white females covertly and perhaps unconsciously conduct with white males as they white females parade in front of white
males with the black male a black penis they have captured for their own
the silent dialogue between a white maryland white female and these social confrontations go something like this
now i have one a penis that is bigger and stronger than yours one that i know that you envy as the mothers wives and
sisters of white females white females consciously or unconsciously always have understood
white males envy of black males even though the envy was expressed in terms of white male hysteria over white
women being raped by black males white males knew or suspected that the white female desired
the black penis more than the white one because the white men themselves desired the black penis more than their own
why else cut off the black genitals and take them home thus it is not surprising that there is
an increased white female black male activity initiated in most certain instances by white females who have
signaled to black males that they are available at the same time other white females are
saying that they are going to be policemen firemen and football players just like men and are discussing their lesbian
inclinations openly white males with freud's help have projected their own sense
intense sense of loss injury and adequacy and envy as genetically recessive albino mutants who are being
annihilated genetically by both black non-white males and females it is they white males who have the
primary penis envy which is manifested in her envy of black males penises
they then project their sense of inferiority onto white females causing them to in turn to develop secondary penis envy
the accuser now stands himself accused these dynamics are at the root of the fear of all true competition
white males feel toward black males thus preventing true competition in all areas of people activity
economics education entertainment labor law politics religion sex and war the obscurity of freud's
ideas can be clarified only the system and cultural dynamics of white supremacy are analyzed and understood fully for
this in the context of which freud wrote suffered and died ford attempted to escape his own reality as a semite
in the full meaning of that term was unable to face fully what he was seeing and
experiencing about him about him which was anti-semitism and dynamic of white supremacy he felt it
but he couldn't accurately describe it perhaps because he feared for his life thus his life experience came forth from
his brain computer as abstracted and displaced concepts to see clearly
freud would have had to recognize that he was a viewed as a non-white a semite or mulatto and not an
austrian which like german and american means pure white freud was attempting to desperately like
the other semites in europe and america to be integrated and accepted as white therefore he ended
by seeing only through a glass starkly or really not seeing it all then again
perhaps freud sensed that offending the aryans or whites by making a fully accurate analysis would have
brought disaster before it finally did come in a nazi holocaust personally i see no need to repeat his
fear nor his folly even though the same danger exists
Chapter 8 - PAGES 103-118
the isis papers chapter 8 guns and symbols anthony sampson in his book the arms
bazaar from lebanon to lockheed informs us that the word weapon was until the 14th century
synonymous with penis there are now 25 000 handgun deaths per year in the united
states of america the president of the u.s in 1975 was subjected to two assassination attempts
in the span of three weeks handguns were the instrument used in each assassination attempt
the same president was against handgun control the above statements are latin with
highly significant meaning which is not immediately apparent and which can be understood fully only when the underlying psychodynamics of the
collective white psyche and of the white supremacy power system and its culture approved dissected and revealed joseph kraft
writing in the september 25th 1975 issue of the washington post stated the starting
point for analysis and the recognition that for better or for worse the united states is a country with a thing about
guns prowess with firearms was critical to survival in the frontier days
the right to bear arms is guaranteed in the constitution millions of americans regarding hunting as a favorite
recreation thousands collect guns as souvenirs i once visited the home in
mechanicsburg ohio of a prominent official in this home no wall was uncovered by some kind of rifle
shotgun pistol or musking the owner william saxby eventually became attorney general
mr kraft later used the term pro-gun culture to describe american culture and society as he
cited that there have been no fewer than five different presidential commissions that have recommended more stringent
forms of gun control while recognizing along with mr craft the predominant use of guns in the
american frontier days i strongly disagree that guns are needed for survival in the simple terms of the
continuation of life after all the native americans taught the europeans how to grow corn to
feed themselves and survive guns were needed however if native non-white americans were going to
be removed successfully from the land that the europeans whites wish to dominate and control
this essay is being written neither in review nor in protest of the horrendous carnage of native american life in
particular nor in protest of the general path of carnage that has been tread in this area of the world
is being written in hopes of shedding light on the seeming dilemma that in spite of the past and present
potential carnage for handguns there is tremendous resistance amongst the dominant population to have guns
as well as all the instruments of life destruction including atomic hydrogen and neutron bombs brought under control in my view the gun
is a critical symbol of the subconscious mind of white peoples everywhere the symbol is primarily operative as are
all true symbols at the unconscious level of brain activity increasing numbers of black behavioral
scientists are beginning to understand that the dominant thrust in what has become known as western civilization is racism
once begin we become aware of the deep humiliation that is apparently felt by whites because of their skin whiteness due to genetic
mutation to albinism and because of the genetic vulnerability when compared to non-whites black brown
red and yellow peoples it is possible to understand the historically degraded status of sex in the white supremacy system culture
sex is the act of self-reproduction an act responsible for the production of the self and the appearance of the self in a
white brain computer if the white pale genetically vulnerable self is degraded then the act that produced itself will
be degraded in the same brain computer an example by a famous western author of
what whites have thought consciously about white skin is presented by mark twain who in his essay skin deep from on the
damned human race stated then there would have been the added disadvantage of the white complexion
it's not an unbearably unpleasant complexion when it keeps to itself and when it becomes comes into
competition with masses of brown and black the fact is betrayed it is endurably only because we are used to it
nearly all black and brown skins are beautiful but a beautiful white skin is rare how rare the one may learn by
walking down a street in paris new york or london on a weekday particularly an unfashionable street and keep count of the satisfactory
complexions encountered in the course of a mile where dark complexions are masked they make the white look bleached out and
wholesome and sometimes frankly ghastly the acts of self-production and
self-reproduction are not only targets of degradation in the white psyche or brain computer within the thought and logic processes
of the white psyche the genitals themselves are degraded both male and female genitals those
parts of the anatomy and physiology are the responsible for self-reproduction and production especially the white male
sexual apparatus is seen as inferior and inadequate when compared to the sexual apparatus of the black male
see chapter seven in the may 1977 issue of medical aspects of human sexuality
in an article entitled men's fear of having too small a penis by pavel w toonsig md writes a
surprisingly large number of men fear that their penises are not of adequate size although
to snake makes no reference to the grace or color of the man he interviewed it is known in clinical practice that
this is not a major fear of black man however he does state it is hard to determine
the exact origin of the myth of the big penis in many cultures such as ancient egypt that the penis did become a fertility
symbol and was consequently pictured with enormous dimensions in classic greece however small genitals
were considered more beautiful than larger ones romans reversed its concept and western culture
appears by and large to have followed them it is interesting that tusing makes no
mention of any attempt to measure the penis size of white and black men in a culture heavily laden with a specific
white male preoccupation a culture in which large numbers of white males are daily
in close proximity to black males and aware of the presence in society especially in the arena of sports games
symbolic of special male prowess and virility where black males dominate interestingly
clyde keeler writing on albinism in an article entitled kuna moon child albinism 1950-1970
states the voice quality of albino males is soft and higher pitched than in moreno males the addition in addition they appear to
be deficient in sex hormone and while they may be fertile they have a lower phallic posture due to
flaccidity albinos usually have flabby muscles and reduce muscular strength as shown by manu and numerator
readings this is of interest because in my view
all skin whiteness is related to the albinism of variant thereof keeler's observation implies that there
may be a genetic association between albino or white skin color and the appearance and posture of the penis
albinism influencing small penis size or lack of penis posture causing its appearance to be small
also it is known that in comparison to the black population whites have less muscle definition thus
muscular flabbiness compared to blacks it may be said that the most fundamental
there is a genetic basis and secondarily an anatomic and physiologic basis for the white fear of
white genetic annihilation this is in turn became the basis for the global system of white supremacy
domination and its attendant culture a system and culture evolved and structured to prevent white genetic
annihilation and to ensure white genetic survival indeed if the understood threat to white
genetic survivor was the black male's genital apparatus consciously or unconsciously
the white psyche would be compelled to produce a weapon of defense of comparable or greater power than that
of the black male's penis and testicles it should be made clear that the black male's genital apparatus is the most
feared relative to the genital apparatus of other non-white males because it is possessing the greatest potential to produce
melanin the pigment responsible for all true skin color black males have the greatest genetic
potential to annihilate the global white minority the individual and collective white brain computer given that task of
solving the global problem of white genetic survival eventually evolved a solution and form of technology
that would address the specific issue of white genetic and genital weakness or inadequacy
technology also is developed to take over the point of the human organism's anatomical and physiological limitation thus the
white brain computer printout was a weapon that would be the exact symbolic replica of the male genitalia a weapon that
would take over at the point of limitation of the white male genital apparatus an apparatus that had the very specific
limitation of being unable to annihilate blacks and other people of color genetically diagrams one through four illustrate
what i am stating from the above four drawings it is clear
that the gun in its essential shape and function is the exact counterpart of the functioning
genital apparatus into the erect penis that is ejaculated in other words the handle and taper are
analogous to the testicles a barrel of the gun is analogous to the penis the bullets are the sperm
contained in the ejaculate with the genetic material in a white psyche genetic annihilation by blacks or other non-whites is
experienced as destruction of life by the black genital apparatus the firing gun and function
achieves for the whites the destruction of the lives of blacks and other non-white people thus to the extent that the guns
manufactured and made by the white collective in the context of white supremacy system culture were used against blacks and other
genetically dominant colored people on earth they became the answer at least a temporarily
comforting answer to the great fear of white genetic annihilation the gun became not only the weapon to
develop technology to ensure white genetic survival but it also became a symbolic white penis
thus it is no accident that white males often refer to one another as son of a gun this is a symbolically
determined pattern of speech and i am certain that white males who use it have not understood in depth why such a
phrase entered the remains of their brain computers the phrase deprecates the white male genital apparatus that
fathers white people with their genetically deficient state of albinism it says instead that the white male
prefers the gun to be his fowlers and the phallus of his father the gun then becomes the
desired all-powerful phallus of the white male which he conceives as being an equalizer to the phallus of
black and other non-white males the symbolism underlying the production of the gun and the white psyche and the
white supremacy system culture also explains the western expression god did not create all men equal
but colonel colt did referring to the creator of the cult revival revolver
apparently white males were thinking at an unconscious level to be sure that god did not create them to be
genetically equal to men of color but their technology of compensation was the gun
understanding this gun symbolism also clarifies the observation of anthony sampson in the opening paragraph of this essay that the
word weapon was up until the 14th century synonymous with penis and western white civilization the gun
is not the only weapon in a white supremacy system culture that in form and function is symbolic of the functioning male genital apparatus
the cannon with its cannon wheels and long black nozzle or tube and big black cannonball shot out as
projectiles is one example similarly bullets and bombs are dark colored and resemble individual sperm in
general general shape and form and it is a further observance that the gun and these other weapons
usually are painted black or at least dark in color in contrast to these dark colored weapons
are the more recently developed missiles that are often painted white but again shaped as gigantic white
penises these white phallic symbols are now the super weapons of the superman and the superior race it is of a great
interest of these modern large white missiles around the vast majority of non-white peoples on the planet and when used can counter
the threat of white genetic annihilation knowledge and understanding of these symbols will make clear the meaning of
the washington monument and in addition its proximity to the dome jefferson memorial in
washington dc when these two architectural structures are viewed at a distance they look like
diagram b it is not apparent that this is the same
side view of the penis and the testicles that are the base of the form and structure of the gun the same lateral view in abstract form
of the penis and testicles was the symbol for the world fair held in new york in 1941 to 1942
with all of the above in mind let us again return to the gun upon brief reflection it would be noted
that traditionally in the white supremacy culture guns were are worn on the hip on both hips of the male
at the exact level of the male genitals it is no accident that in this culture the act of ejaculating is often referred
to as shooting off when a man wearing a gun and a holster is viewed laterally
the gun appears exactly as a side view of the penis and testicles if guns are worn on both hips and
brought together centrally on the belt to the vertically midline of the body they present the full face view of the penis
and both testicles in the u.s the most popular hero has been the gunfire now the present-day
detective or lawman the first chapter of paul trackman's book the gunfighters and
is entitled the deadly brotherhood of the gun the gunfighters came into prominence following the close of the civil war
most of the gunfighters were southerners who felt humiliated by the loss of their slaves in the war and by the temporary
appearance of power held by blacks who were their former black slaves
the resulting deep sense of white male insecurity inadequacy was compensated for by the obsessive use of the gun
this was the era of frank and jesse james billy the kid and a host of others for whom the gun made up for a sense of
profound and deep inadequacy hidden by a thorough and ruthless exterior that the lives of others were
treated with little value merely reflected the failed sense of inadequate of adequacy and diminished sense of importance in
their own lives during the same period the gory sport of cockfighting was highly popular and important
important as a diversion among ranchers in the west thus it is not surprising that the white
male also referred to his penis as a or that when a gun dissembled the white male phallus is prepared for
firing it is first cocked in this area of the world of white supremacy system
a detective who always carries a gun is the most important hero the detective with its gun has been
referred to as a dick from this came the long-term comic strip hero detective
dick tracy the white male also has referred to his penis as a dick
and it cannot be ignored at the first child all american all american children still meet in primary public school
is a white male child named dick along with his sister jane in effect at this early age the
white male child is being instructed to recognize that his identity is synonymous with penis or gun
these symbolic reinforcements continue until his death and that is why there is continuing necessity for gun violence
via television for america and white children all of the above has been stated not
only to a point out of basic preoccupation of the white supremacy system culture with the threat of white genetic annihilation but more
importantly to shed light on why there cannot and will not be gun control or weapon control in the global white
supremacy system culture with the gun being the symbolic genitalia of the white male
his answer to the threat to white genetic survival gun control would represent white male genetic
genital castration such gun control would spell the immediate end of white genetic survival
on earth john ellis in his book the social history of the machine gun states the odds were so in favor of the natives
that the white men were obliged to adopt all weapons that would help to maximize their firepower in all parts of the continent
against zulus dervishes he heroes matabele and many other peoples gatlings
gardeners and maxims sight down anyone who dared to stand in the way of the imperialist advance
without the handful of machine guns the british south african company might have lost rhodesia
luggard might have been driven out of uganda and the germans of the tanganyika without hearing maxim
such a subsequent world history might have been very different ella's further remarks in africa
automatic weapons were used to support the seizure of millions of square miles of land and to discipline those unfortunates who wished to
escape the beliefs of european civilization with machine guns in their armory mere
handfuls of white men plundered in visionaries civilians and soldiers were able to scoff at the objections
of the africans themselves and impose their rule on the whole continent dustin's area of white supremacy system
there in 1975 there were 25 000 deaths caused by guns that there cannot be gun control
guns and missiles are viewed as essential aspects of white male anatomy and physiology it is an accident that in
the new us white male children learn to use guns before they learn to use their penises
while black male children learn to use their penises before they use their guns i will close with further observations
following a lecture that i presented in los angeles california in may 1977 in which i included a discussion on
the symbolism of the gun and the white male psyche a white male in the audience pointed out the parallel
symbolism in a large black umbrella often carried by white males in a white supremacy culture
i agreed that this observation seemed to be a valid one the long black umbrella carried
everywhere became a part of the standard dress of the well-to-do englishman at a time when it was said that the sun never sets on the
british empire of course this great empire consisted of control over vast numbers of non-white
men and their genitals that had the power to annihilate whites the white man's traditional long
black umbrella said in effect i also have a large black phallus or at least a phallic symbol that denotes my
importance and power and the power over the black male genital apparatus
the same symbolism explains a recent murder in washington dc a white male shot a white female
companion in the mouth as she was in bed with two other white females engaged in sexual activity that
all four had been involved in earlier as the white female victim was engaged in being sexually pleasured by two white
females the white male who was left out feeling genitally rejected and inadequate
compared to females compared to two females pulled out and used consciously or unconsciously his
preferred symbolic penis the gun the isis papers chapter 9 the
Chapter 9 - PAGES 119-130
and the original i've defined racism as the behavioral
power system of logic thought speech action emotional response and perception
whether consciously or unconsciously determined and persons who classify themselves as white the goal of racism is why
domination over the vast majority of the world's people whom the whites classified as non-whites
black brown red and yellow in order to ensure white genetic survival
my interest in the phenomenon of racism has resulted from my awareness of the negative impact this destructive system has on the lives and
behavior of the vast majority of people on this planet who are non-white and who are the
victims of this power system the specific nature of the destructiveness of racism was set forth
by the caucus of black psychiatrists at the 1969 annual meeting of the american
psychiatric association in miami beach florida the blackhawks stated that racism was not only the
number one mental health problem in this nation but additionally was the number one cause of all of the mental health
problems racism is carried out in all areas of people activity economics
education entertainment labor law politics religion sex and war as explained by nigly fuller
in his book the united independent compensatory code system concept from the above it follows
that if the basic underlying psychodynamic motivations in the individual and collective white psyche are understood
that is survive as mutant genetic deficient minority which includes the
evolution of a power system to ensure that survival then all patterns of white behavior
eventually can be decoded and fully understood whether they are patterns of logic thought speech action
emotional response and or perception in any of the nine areas of people activity
similarly because of all non-white peoples on the planet earth are now subject to and affected by
the global white supremacy system if the white psyche is decoded and understood fully it is possible to decode and understand
the present behavioral manifestations of all those people who are victims of white supremacy domination and oppression the total
non-white majority as a collective and as individuals the term
is a pattern of speech used with extremely high frequency amongst black people
specifically black males in the u.s in my attempt to decode and understand this particular pattern of high frequency
behavior language use it was necessary to begin the knowledge that all black peoples like all other
non-white people are relatively powerless victims of the white supremacy system irrespective of their income levels
i then examine certain other specific patterns of language used by black males within the white supremacy
culture to begin with black males in particular also black females refer to the white male as
the man once this term the man is thought or uttered the brain computes
the unit that in as much as there are only five major categories of people man woman
boy girl and baby if the white man is the man meaning logically the only man
then any other male must be one of the four remaining people categories boy girl woman or baby
historically black males have fought being referred to as boy by white males and females only
recently has the use of this degrading appellation ceased to some extent although there is a current television
series called chico and the man the title implies the boy and the man the man of course is
white and chico is non-white male because the use of the word boy in reference to black male ceased
it only meant that black males couldn't then refer to themselves as any one of the remaining three categories of people
baby woman or girl it certainly did not imply that black males would be referred to as equals
of white males this never could occur under the system of white supremacy domination
when the use of the word boy was no longer the term of common reference for black males by whites black males began referring to
themselves as baby but until most recently into the changes in dress and clothing styles most black
males deeply resented any reference to themselves as girl or woman but the recent style
changes towards high heeled shoes curled hair hair curlers braids earrings bracelets
necklaces pocket books mid-drift tops cinch-waisted pants etc that many black males have adopted now
suggest that there's a developing tendency wide spread amongst black males to not mind consciously or unconsciously
being mistaken for a girl or a woman however at present the term baby is a fully accepted appellation
for black males in reference to one another it is thus not uncommon to hear one black male say to
another hey baby what's happening in addition to black males frequently referring to one
another as baby many black females often refer to their black male peers and companions as
baby while black adult females refer to black adult males as baby black adult males often refer to black
adult female peers and companions as mama often expecting those mamas to
provide food clothing and shelter for them it is not uncommon to hear hey mama can i ride
with you further black adult males also refer to the place where they sleep is
a crib the brain discomputes an adult male who refers to another adult male as
the man being the only man to himself his baby to the woman that he sleeps with as mama
and to the place where he sleeps as a crib will call himself or any other black male reflection of
himself a thus it is clear that the original the origin of the specific
pattern of street speech begins with the perhaps unconscious recognition that within the framework of
white supremacy power system and its reflecting culture power rests only in the hands of whites
more specifically in the hands of the white male and relative to the white male the black
male is a powerless baby all babies everywhere are powerless compared to adult males or men
is therefore a profound political statement as it addresses itself to an existing
and specific set of power relationships namely the white male's continuing dominance over the black man
it is a confrontation with the stated fact of the social and functional powerlessness in this total context of the white
supremacy culture that causes one black male to explosively challenge and fight another black male when called with the proper
negative vocal intonations this is true because black males are
totally uncomfortable with the reality that their relative powerlessness compared to white males even though this awareness or of powerlessness is
more than unconsciously repressed and consciously dealt with in a black male psyche
it is my estimate that seventy percent of the black male on male homicides follow the use of the term
said in a specific tone it implies that the unconscious gut level you are a powerless baby the reality and
awareness of black male powerlessness in the context of the white supremacy culture causes such gut and psychic pain for the black male
that the brain computer switched over to the very deep levels of the unconscious mind in the realm of the region of symbolic
word formation and thinking here the brain pieces together encoded symbolic language the
phraseology that hides from the conscious mind the continuing existence and activity of a totally unacceptable reality
indeed there is no single term that is more emotionally charged nor phrase that is used more often by
black males in the us than it suggests that the most obvious of all realities for black males
is their powerlessness relative to the power of the white male in a system of cultures racism
but it is not sufficient to have the code of this particular word pattern in the white supremacy culture the
question indeed arises why is this particular word formation a combination used to denote black
powerlessness this more fundamental question can be answered again however it is necessary
to begin with the psyche of those who organize the white supremacy power system as well as the fundamental reasons and motivations behind its
origin the total worldwide collective has been involved in the establishment and maintenance of the white supremacy power
system it is however the white male who has been involved most specifically in
the systems establishment maintenance the system's major characteristics thus reflect more of the
projections of his psyche and those of his female counterpart i stated in the beginning of this book
that whites are undoubtedly a genetic mutant albino population they are albino mutants from the origin
original black human beings causing the formation of a mankind and humankind this statement is given strong
support by the work of the anthropologist lewis leakley who stated in his book by the evidence
that human life began in africa and that the first human beings were black for the modern science of genetics we
know that it is possible for all pigmented population groups to produce white albino mutants
we also know that it is impossible for albino mutants to produce black offspring as reported in national
geographic and national history magazines recently found in africa was the first known albino gorilla infant
who was the offspring of its cold black gorilla mother and father this evidence strongly supports the
extrapolation that if a higher primate in this instance a cold black gorilla can produce a platinum blonde blue eyed
pink skinned albino and certainly this could also be the pattern by which blonde blue-eyed
pink-skinned white men and women also were produced as genetic mutants or albino
mutants from the black norm that the norm for the entire human family is to possess melanin pigmented skin supports
that extrapolation the albino mutants that easily could have evolved in africa either we could
have been chased northward by the pigmented parents and kinsmen or they could have migrated northward on
their own away from the intensely sunny environment of africa where their non-pigmented defective skins were
not not by damaged by the less than ten sunrays moving directly northward from africa
one lands in europe the now recognized home of the whites the main point of this perhaps
seemingly discursive discussion is that white skin albino persons were mostly most probably the genetic
mutant offspring from black parents in other words black males and black females were the parents the
original mothers and fathers of the albino or white population the marriage of
albinos with one another subsequently produced what is now known as the white race
this description of the origin of whites is accurate as the writer strongly believes then deep within the unconscious psyche of
the white collective is an awareness of their origin amongst blacks the blacks were the parents and that they
were whites were defective offspring of blacks the white male the prime organizer of
the white supremacy system culture is thus aware although perhaps at deep unconscious levels that his original
mother was a black woman just as his original father was a black man therefore
in spite of the overt psychological need to repress this fundamental knowledge of origin the conscious recognition of which would
necessitate a confrontation with the genetic mutant and genetic defective status of skin whiteness white males have exposed
their unconscious awareness by referring to black women in this world area as mammy or aunt or auntie referring to
black males as pappy and uncle these terms cannot reflect true
simple endearment is they occur in the presence of degradation enslavement oppression and black
destruction further white males strongly supported black females suckling white babies and
also endorsed black male and men and women caring for white children the extension of the white male himself
his close contact of the white child particularly with the black female was supported by the white male in spite
of the degraded slave and oppressed status with the white collective imposed upon a black collective
thus as the white baby suckled the breast of the black woman the white adult male as he watched the black slave mammy suckle his white baby
could unconsciously fantasize himself as being at the breast of the original black mother even more significant is the fact
that the white male could not abstain from making sexual aggressions toward the black female indeed some of the most important
founding fathers of the so-called united states of america were involved actively and continuously
in relationships with black women i.e george washington and thomas jefferson this pattern of sexual aggression of the
white male towards the black female continues unabated to this day ultimately is
little wonder that black stockings black underwear black sleep were items of sexual stimulation for the white male
collective it should be noted that the term sexual aggression is used to imply a sexual relationship between political and
equals the white male is power and black female like black male
is powerless sexual favors are thus directly and or indirectly forced from powerless partner
each time the white male imposed or imposes himself sexually upon a black female at the deep levels of symbolic
thought he can be viewed as having intercourse with the reflection of his original black mother thus the deep and fundamental
psychodynamics of the white supremacy system culture the white male becomes the original
thus through the subtle and intricate dynamics and the unconscious underweavings of the white supremacy system culture
the white male has projected his image of himself as onto the total black collective throughout the world
indeed each time one black male even utters the term to another black male
there is probably some white male on the planet who is having sexual intercourse with a black woman black or non-white
weren't female the symbolic representation of the white male's original black mother
even the white male's pornographic magazines are filled with pictures of white males having intercourse with black females
this need to turn to and have intercourse with the black mother is undoubtedly the true basis for the greek myth
oedipus rex it's explained why the symbolic story or myth continues to have
major significance in the white supremacy system culture the myth of oedipus tells of oedipus sleeping with
his mother the black female and slaying his father the black male the myth of oedipus parallels in
importance the biblical myth of adam and eve which encoded language depicts the origin of the first whites or albinos
from black parents at yet another level the white male's desire to return to the black female in a sexual
encounter also can be viewed as a symbolic attempt to re-enter her womb in hopes of coming
out again being born again non-defective in other words the white male harbors are
an unconscious desire to be born again but without the genetic defeat of melanin pigment deficiency or
albinism it must be noted here that being born again is a major concept in the most
important religion and in white supremacy system culture christianity an extension of the concept of being
born again without genetic defect is to be born without sin and to rid oneself of the
original sin the original sin in white supremacy's christianity on close examination is the act of sex
that produced the appearance of nakedness or the genetic mutation of albinism on white skin
that the concept of sin shame and guilt are related to the naked white body as perhaps an unconscious association
was made manifest when a significant number of white males began to run about naked body whiteness fully exposed at the
height of the watergate scandal when the evil doings of the highest ranked men in the global white supremacy
system became exposed to the world this behavior phenomenon of white men running naked in public
and hiding in shame were called streaking it has been laughed at and discussed but never fully explained before now
it should be noted also in the context that the good book in white supremacy system culture is the bible is most often itself covered
in black almost never in white well let's return from these aside to the main point of
discussion the white male as the original and his sexual return to the black female as an expression of his
unconscious desire to be reborn with black skin within the context of
the american segment of the white supremacy system or culture one of the most popular white male
entertainers was al jolson jolson became famous singing as a white male and black face
pretending that he was black or having a fantasy that he was a black while the white audiences that enjoyed him one
can suspect similarly were engrossed in the same fantasy one of the most popular songs sung by
jolson was mammy he was pretending to be a black offspring of a black woman while singing about how much he loved his dear old
mammy today that song continues to stir the hearts the unconscious of
many white males and i suppose also some white females had jolson had any other white males in
face and simply thinking of a black mammy who had nursed and cared for them there would be
little need to color their own faces black leaving bare their white lips to reveal the color the
effect that was yet present unconscious need for the white male to return to the black woman in the fantasy of being born
again without genetic defect more often than not is performed in the context of degrading the non-white female
this powerful need to degrade the black female who symbolically represents his original black mother is primarily a
result of the genetic dominance of the black and other non-white females over the white male she is able to cause his
genetic annihilation because all of her offspring by the white male or non-white her like herself
thus the white male each year in every encounter with a non-white female is confronted forcefully with the
deficiency of his genetic status and is reminded of his true status as a recessive genetic mutant
he feels degraded in the encounter with the black female because of her genetic dominance and soul must in turn
seek to degrade her ultimately the white male views the black female as a threat to his survival
on the planet a secondary factor causing a white male to feel the need to degrade the black female and sexual encounters
is the white males and females anger toward the original black mother whites blame the original black mother
from giving birth to them with genetic deficiency albinism the anger is still being acted
out by the white male against a black female this anger is reflected in the reports of many black females who have had
sexual encounters with white males and report that white males often want not only to ejaculate in their faces and over their
bodies but also want to urinate and defecate on them as part of the sexual encounter
and it's certainly clear that many white males relate to white families in this manner
but it is known to all that white males look down upon and degrade white females this degradation of the
white female by the white male is the basis of the white females current woman's liberation movement
the very high perhaps unconscious level of psychic pain experienced by the white male because of this genetic deficiency
as an albino variant and his neurotic desire to be born again from the original black mother is perhaps the reason why the
phrase is such an awesome phrase for the white male to utter
it is phrased that the white male is almost unable to bring his vocal apparatus to form this is in stark contrast to the
frequent uttering of the phrase by black males when translated the terms mean
functional powerlessness from the black male in the context of the white supremacy system culture
however it is an externally imposed powerlessness for the white male on the other hand the
same phrase has an even more disturbing frightening and devastating meaning in the same sense in
the same systemic and cultural context for the white male the term translates into not functional powerlessness that
is externally imposed but his own genetic powerlessness such a consideration is totally unthinkable at
the conscious level and even the unconscious level for the white male psyche the basis for certain specific patterns
of words usage in a white supremacy system culture is imposed to fully comprehend without an understanding of
the origin of that system culture white supremacy racism began with the production of the first albino mutants
from black mothers and fathers in africa once isolated these recessive genetic mutants began
to mate with one another and multiply producing what is known as the white race the white race
historically is sought to hide its genetic origins in africa amongst blacks just as it is
sought to deny the origins of the white civilization from the culture of blacks
in africa seeking instead to proclaim an origin amongst the greeks historically whites have also sought to
degrade africa and everything black by doing so whites can avoid confronting the true meaning of skin whiteness
as a mutation and genetic deficiency state from the black norm the human norm
Chapter 10 - PAGES 131-144
the isis papers chapter 10 ball games and symbols the war of the balls dedication
this chapter is dedicated to all the black men who through sports and through ball games in particular symbolically are recapturing the balls
but that is also a part of the struggle they're forcing the oppresses of black people up against a psychological wall and thereby heightening the
contradiction sometimes during certain periods there's a conscious refocusing on certain
segments of reality data and ladder due to the dynamics within the total environment the same body of data slips into the
realm of unconsciousness for individuals as well as for the total collective that for example in the framework of the
white supremacy system culture and its current phase of refinement is no longer in vogue to
lynch black men hang them on trees and castrate them it's no longer the style to speak overtly in terms of killing
thus there are many who believe that these activities these thoughts and acts have ceased to be a part of reality within the culture
however these modes of thought and behavior were handed consciously and overtly in the recent past only until
ball games became fully established as the major national indeed global pastimes in the
western civilization the global white supremacy system culture and the sum total of its
conscious as well as the unconscious tactics strategies and methodologies evolved in all areas of
people activity additionally these maneuvers seek to prevent white genetic annihilation
and attempt to resolve the psychological anxiety and tension related to that ever-present threat thus the task of
white supremacy domination require constant vigilance the deep pervading fear of white genetic annihilation in
the white psyche is causing neurotic unconscious preoccupation with genes genetic material and those aspects of
the human anatomy that either contain or transport the genetic material in a sexual act the act of self-reproduction or
self-annihilation as is a possibility in the case of the whites since blacks black or other males of
color are the only ones who actually can initiate and carry forth the act of white genetic annihilation through
sexual intercourse the white preoccupation was
is specifically with male genitalia as opposed to female namely the testicles the balls and the
penis the testicles contain a genetic material and the penis transports the genetic material in the act of
ejaculation thus in the white brain computer there is a dominant association between balls testicles and contests of power
because the white genetic survival conflict is not handled overtly and consciously there is a neurotic
preoccupation in the white psyche with genes genetic material testicles and penises
yet at another level the preoccupation was is actually with warfare continuous
warfare is acquired to prevent the genetic annihilation of the global white minority warfare in this sense refers to
the domination and destruction of all people of color particularly black males and their balls
by every necessary means which have included the initiation of
infertility epidemics in africa games although there are commonly held
views that games are merely a form of play and entertainment even when they are played professionally and that for the most part
the permanent the permanent fascination of g of games lies simply in the pure joy of playing them the child
psychiatrist realizes that for the young games and play are the work of children it is
one of the means by which through the handling of toys and objects in a symbolic way children master adult role expectations
and attempt to resolve unconscious conflicts brought by the dynamics and interplay of factors in
their surrounding environment play in games then become a child's unconscious attempt to master
the environment its conflicts and threats to the child's sense of security those who have taken the trouble to
study games through the world realize that not only the play and games of children but most specifically the games in adult
life as participated in by a given people reflect their history folklore traditions and conflicts
frederick v grunfield in his book games of the world has stated through the modes of games play tend to
remain constant their symbolism is often influenced by contemporary events particularly by the
politics of the day during the napoleonic wars for example chess sets were made
showing napoleon is general napoleon's first council napoleon as emperor always of course with the corsican
assuming the position of the white king the suggestive the suggestion here is that all ball
games and white supremacy system culture similarly play out at an unconscious level dominant
political i.e power concerns the fundamental power concern in white supremacy system cultures why genetic
survival do white supremacy domination such domination can be established and maintained only if
white males and females the total white collective control all of the balls testicles of non-white men off and on
the playing fields and ball courts in other words the name of the real game the power game
is continuous worldwide control of the testicles of all non-white men by white males and females as the only
means of ensuring white genetic survival in the world where the melanin producing genetic material of non-whites is dominant
without control of the non-white genetic material whites will be annihilated genetically since these facts of genetic
reality can be neither denied or discussed at the conscious level of brain activity this dominant theme is manifested daily
at the symbolic level via games with symbolic balls footballs baseballs soccer balls handballs golf
balls ping pong balls earth balls hockey pucks etc these symbolic ball
games have a highly important role to play at the unconscious level informing all white males especially but
also females to keep their attention in their eyes constantly fixed on the balls as a matter of life and death
the high level anxiety and fear associated with the continuous threat to why genetic survival must be played out
symbolically through the numerous forms of ball games all of these games are played
mainly by men are centered on who has the ball and who are concerned with who finally
controls the ball when the game of power ends the anxiety and tension that accompanies
ball games is parallel to the anxiety and tension experienced at the thought in the white psyche of white genetic
annihilation similarly the increasing violence that accompanies ball games parallels the
increasing level of violence needed to maintain global white supremacy as the entire non-white world seeks its
liberation from white domination some of these highly symbolic ball games
are played with white balls and others are played with colored balls usually black or brown generally the white balls
are small in size whereas the colored balls are much larger in size paralleling their respective genetic power in the white
and colored testicles currently the most popular games those that attract most male attention are played with big brown
balls footballs and basketballs this rise in popularity of colored balls parallels the rise in power
at the global level of the third world of non-white nations also as white females demand their
liberation from white males in order to become co-equals in running the global system of white supremacy
they simultaneously seek expression of this equality by participating in all the ball games
including football and basketball at the same time white females step up their sexual aggression toward black and
other non-white males greatly increasing the incidence of white female black male marriages and
these arrangements to white female obtains control of the black and other non-white male balls
non-white males and females are powerless under the global system of white supremacy domination
as a threat to white domination and thus the threat to why genetic survival increases at the global level
a mass hysteria develops over playing with balls until the entire society and social system is either watching
or playing ball games it is a little wonder that violence is becoming an increasingly dominant aspect of ball
games when it is understood that behind the symbolism of the ball games is a very survival of the white
race when war is in progress the top priority is always the status of the war
white supremacy racism is a war against all persons classified as non-white in the meantime the balls are
passed hit bounced dribbled batted punted kicked thrown shot rolled struck driven caught and captured
to see who is the final possessor of the balls or to see who is the most agile astute or strongest in mastering
and controlling the balls another point that effectively reveals the relationship of ball games to white
psyche is and emphasizes the extent to which balls are a symbolic preoccupation
is the referenced in the white supremacy system culture to the act of sexual intercourse's ballin the ball fantasy and the white psyche
can best be stated is if the balls can be controlled in the court or the playing field or through ownership
they can also be owned and controlled in real life it is little wonder that in constant in contrast to black males
white males play ball games as though they are a matter of life and death and not as though they are simply to be
enjoyed when whites lose control of the balls whiteness becomes extinct
it is no accident that the phrase to blackball in the language of the white supremacy system
culture means to exclude and to have the power to exclude similarly the genetic
material in the black testicles black balls has the power to genetically exclude or annihilate the recessive
genetic material in the white testicles hence when drop of one drop of black blood black genetic
material makes you black a highly familiar expression in the white supremacy culture
now specific ball games close examination of specific phenomenon and ball games that
are popular in white supremacy culture will support the preceding discussion in a game of billiards a pool there are
eight colored balls a white ball and a long dark stick placed on a table
the object of the game is to use the long stick and causing the white ball to knock all the colored balls under the
table the last colored ball knocked under the table is the black ball when the game is over the white ball is
the only ball that remains on top and a table with a long dark stick then
the game starts again bowling is also an interesting ball game in white supremacy culture
usually the game is played with a large black ball being rolled forcefully down an alley where it is expected to knock
down 10 white pins the central pin is referred to as the kingpin
clearly the bowling pins are white and in shape are phallic symbols in other words depends on white phallic
symbols that are knocked asunder by a heavy black ball over which the bowler attempts to gain mastery
in symbolic fantasy the bowler sees himself as master and possessor of the larger black ball and thereby in control of the harm it
can bring to the white male genetic genital apparatus the white penis the white pens
bowling was introduced to america by dutch colonists in the 18th century it's derivative of the french game
guys that was brought to england in the 19th century and later to germany
games that consist of throwing balls of various eyes and sizes back to ancient rome and
greece early coaches that had extensive contact with black men in africa a modern french derivative of the
ancient game is gender boos fv grunfield states the french whites
play bullets with what was been described as a mild fanaticism
it is well to recall that a considerable period of french history was spent controlling black and brown men in africa and asia
earth ball is a modern american version of an ancient game it is played as a
struggle between the two teams or tribes who jostle run push elbow one another to move the large dark
colored ball in the desired direction and to gain possession of it the game attempts to develop a sense of
common purpose amongst the members of a tribe or team this game was started in california with
most if not all players being white the importance of games utilizing large
brown balls in the white supremacy system culture is of a special interest the most important of these games are
football and basketball it is only an ancient an accident it is only accident that
black males now that have been allowed to play have become the most outstanding players in these sports
nationally and internationally it is only an accident is it only an accident that in the game of football
the field general the quarterback almost always must be white no matter the color of the other
players and of course the owners always must be white so that no matter who wins or who is the star
the white owner controls the big brown balls and who gets to play with them it is of symbolic importance that the
large brown basketball is thrown into a circular opening the basket usually a white net it can be
viewed as a symbol of the white female vaginal orifice similarly the large brown football is kicked through the
white upright openings the goalposts that can be viewed again symbolically as the uplifted legs of a
white female in the act of sexual intercourse perhaps unconsciously the white male psyche
considers that the white females preference preferred sexual choices tall dark and handsome and tossing or
kicking the large brown balls into the white net or the white goalposts the white male is able to fantasize that he is satisfying
a white female maximally being identification with the black male and the brown balls
which the white male in play believes he now possesses their controls this writer is reminded that the common
underground thought of saying a white man that is they they are not really men until they have had sexual intercourse with a black female
this again is a demonstration of white males fantasizing that they are customary role of the black males
whose genitals they apparently admire and envy thus the black male is their true
standard of real manhood and genetic power the ultimate controller of the black ball as white males attempt to master
the placement of these large brown balls playing balls and openings their activity can be viewed as
attempts to resolve the dilemma of the self-questioned manhood the manhood is always in question because of genetic
recessive status compared to the genetic dominance of the world's majority
in this regard it is not surprising that large numbers of white females hang around black basketball and football players at these black males
and that these black males are trapped into sexual involvement by these white females the black male ball players in turn also
are considered all conditioned under white supremacy domination to want to place brown balls and white nets white vaginal orifices
as a mark of supposed true black manhood since black male males refer to white males as
the man placing brown balls and white nets in between white goal goalposts the blackmailers fan fantasy becomes
the man cocky a sport that black men are not allowed to play in the white
supremacy culture also consists of attempting to play a round black object the hockey puck
into a white ned opening symbolic of the white vaginal orifice the object that is used to play the
black puck place the black puck in a opening is a long-colored stick
symbolic of the black phallus white males fight ferociously among themselves to get the black round object
in the white net opening as the test of the strength or the manhood apparently for the white male
psyche and its anathema to have to have to compete with the black male the possessor of the real black balls
and stick in this challenge controlling the black ball in the black stick and getting the black object into the symbolic white
net opening on a white ice field soccer or european football
traditionally is played with a white ball smaller than a large brown football and basketball the sport is less popular in
the united states but it is very popular in central and south america the white soccer ball is not to be
touched with the hands it is knocked and kicked the kicking of the white ball
becomes a very violent and vicious activity again however the greatest player the master of the large white ball
turned out to be a black brazilian pele who married a white female the owners of the professional soccer
teams also remain white of course another popular ball game played with the smaller white ball is baseball
baseball was the great american the great all-time american aka white sport until a black man hank
aaron became the world's greatest hitter controller of that white ball hitting it with a brown or black bat it
is little wonder that he has moved even closer to taking the title of control away from the white
black white babe ruth aaron began to receive letters from
white people threatening his life this behavior remains incomprehensible after all
it's only a game unless one is aware that the white ball is symbolic of the white testicles that a black man had
knocked out of the ballpark the black man in this manner controls the symbolic small white testicles
this is not psychologically tolerable in the white supremacy culture as it represents white genetic
annihilation which whites traditionally have killed to prevent this unconscious response to non-whites
controlling white balls clarifies the reason that a couple of years ago the american little league team white
which consistently was being beaten by non-white children in taiwan
was prevented from competing further with these non-white children and now the american children are prohibited from playing with the
taiwanese teams white male children must not be confronted in the white supremacy culture
with the non-white children controlling white balls testicles such a continuing experience is totally
inconsistent with the option with the optimal development of the white supremacy psyche as well as with the white male's
survival need to control all the balls on the planet earth next smaller in diameter in the white
ball series is tennis ball to date there has been only one black male world champion
controller of that small white ball after ash although although amongst blacks althea
gibson became a master of the white ball before ash it is only a coincidence
is it only a coincidence that when ash began to play tennis with champion force the game then allowed the introduction
of colored tennis balls in the major tournaments a black male is just not supposed to bat
a small white ball into total submission ash became the number one world ranked tennis champion in 1975 but he did not
sustain that position in 1976 ash has been quoted as saying that he does not play just to win
but for the enjoyment of the sport this attitude is in stark contrast to that of jimmy connors hawaii
who has stated that he plays only to win and is described as approach to the game as a killer instinct
i can imagine a psychological pressure put on arthur ashe as long as he remained in a position of champion controlling
the small white tennis balls i'm certain that he could be liked better in the context
of the white supremacy culture as long as he held any position other than number one controller of the prestigious small white tennis
ball the smallest ball in the popular white ball series is the golf ball
like tennis golf has been the ball game of the most powerful males in the white supremacy system culture
however like tennis it is spreading slowly throughout the white supremacy culture to include large numbers of whites
and non-white females interestingly golf the most elite of all the ball
games in the white supremacy culture is played with a long dark colored stick or iron held between the legs this iron is
smashed against the side of the very ball the small white ball the object is to knock this small white ball into a hole
in the black earth black mother earth the black female by attempting to place a small white ball
in the black earth using a long dark stick again the white male is attempting to identify with the possession
of the genital equipment and privilege of the black male whose rightful partner is the black female if this pattern of golf and
pattern of play and golf does not qualify as the very essence of male genital symbolism and neurotic conflict
in a white male psyche as formulated in a specific discussion then nothing does
again it is only a coin is it only a coincidence that the major event and golf competition should be
called the masters tournament is this not a fitting title for the most elite of all ball games
played by the masters of the master race one final question is it a reflection of the white melons
to mark male self-hate and self-rejection and rejection of the inadequacy of the white testicles or balls
that the games played with small white balls involved the balls being attacked hit struck and knocked far away from the
body in an act of masochism whereas by contrast the games played with large brown balls involve
holding on to and possessing the balls no large brown balls are struck with the
objects and the white supremacy cultures popular ball games there is indeed significance in these facts
and even though the large black bowling ball is rolled away from the body its aim is to knock down symbols of the
white phallus further is there a parallel significance in the fact that the most powerful man in the global white supremacy system
gerald ford on the day of his departure from often office after losing the presidential election
left immediately to play golf to beat the small white balls masochistically across the fairway
in his hour in defeat of humiliation it is a further note that his predecessor who was forced from office in absolute
disgrace also spends much of the time on the golf course beating small white balls
it seems of interest the more that the more powerful the white male becomes in the context of the white supremacy
culture the smaller the ball that becomes his focus of attention is this because the more the white male
achieves that he wants to believe his was real power the greater the realization that his perception
was only inadequate compensation for fundamental lack of truth power genetic power it is
is it not also curious that when white males are young and vigorous they attempt to master the large brown balls
but as they become older and wiser they psychologically reign themselves to the inability to master the large brown
balls the focus often shifts masochistically to hitting the tiny white golf balls and disgust
and resignation in full final realization of white genetic recessiveness it will be a further interest to
ascertain a number of army generals in the white supremacy system who play golf the mean white genetic material while
planning for race war of the destruction of non-white genetic
genetic material after the chinese and non-white people under white supremacy domination for
many decades were able to chase the whites out of the country the most popular ball game in
china became ping pong the object of the game is to smash a tiny white ball back and
forth across the table perhaps in unconscious retaliation for the humiliation imposed upon the chinese
people by the whites the chinese finally mastered beat the white balls
similarly golf and baseball two white ball games have become the most popular ball games in japan a country of non-white people
conquered attacked and humiliated an atomic war by white people perhaps at the conscious level
the japanese or non-white people believe that they are imitating the conquerors whom they admire at the
unconscious level however they are in turn humiliating the inadequacy of the white testicles or balls the
dynamics that motivate the conquered and the conquerors are never the same
is there also connection between the defeat of the highly armed americans in the vietnam war wherein white males are beaten by a tiny
nation of non-white people and a fantastic increase in the popularity of tennis to the us the entire u.s nation since
the close of the vietnam war has begun to beat the small white tennis balls to symbolic white testicles following
humiliating defeat or loss of power for the american white nation or did tennis just become popular
after watergate furthermore it is just a coincidence that there was a greatly increased
interest in white females and tennis at the same time that they began their women's liberation movement a movement that attacks white males and
a sense of superiority and movement that has referred to white males as male chauvinist pigs
through the game of tennis white females symbolically can attack the white testicles it's part of the anatomy that is
supposed to make the white male superior to the white female is this also why tennis is becoming increasingly popular among blacks in
america also is there a relationship between the number of white males seeking sex change
operations to remove their hated male genitalia the number of white male physicians willing to perform the surgery and a
white male's loss of vietnam war to non-white men as well as the rise and power of non-white men in general on
the planet i wish an ever increasing success to all black males who participate in ball
games and look forward to the day when the majority of quarterbacks are black or at least appropriation in
proportion to the number of black football players still the most important messages in this
essay is that in the last hundred years the white collective simply has moved from the overt sporting entertainment lynching and
castrating black men removing their testicles thereby controlling their balls to a more highly
refined series of symbolic representations of the same act ball games and whether through lynching
and castration or modern ball games the object in neurotic preoccupation is the same the white male seeks to
prevent non-white males from ever controlling white balls and therefore they must control the
anatomical balls and the contents of the colored anatomical balls the genes of the non-white men
that threaten white genetic survival ball games merely reflect the white collector's admiration
and fear of black testicles the contempt for white testicles and their willingness to fight
no matter how violently to maintain control of the balls on the field and the court which symbolizes every
place on earth this neurotic preoccupation of whites is of course essential for the genetic survival of the race
the rules may change but the gate real game is always the same this deep significance of balls in the
context of the white supremacy system culture cannot be discussed overtly without causing the collapse of the
entire political and psychological white supremacy edifice events in the world of
symbolism are far ahead of the events in a world of conscious reality because the former represents a more
complete recording of the totality of reality data in a brain computer
thus through the world of symbolism perhaps we can gain insight into the world of reality
that must be mastered by decoding and translating symbols we can confront those aspects of
realities generally we would prefer to ignore norman o'brown's statement in love's body sums
it up the axis on which world histories turns in symbolism the axis of world history is making
conscious the unconscious ball games equal war of the balls equals war of the testicles
equals war of the genes equals race war
Chapter 11 - PAGES 145-152
the isis papers chapter 11 the symbolism of smoking objects
as a psychiatrist and behavior analyst i take the position that all major patterns of people behavior within an
evolved system of behavior can be decoded and understood once the ultimate goal objective of the
evolved system of behavior is decoded and understood the failure to decode and comprehend the
ultimate goal objective only permits behavioral units to be dealt with and described as isolated
abstractions without in-depth meaning and certainly without function within a system culture as a whole furthermore this failure
makes it impossible to perceive the logical coherence and interconnectedness between all the major
patterns of behavior in the behavioral system to use an analogy in the physical sciences
the failure to decode and comprehend the ultimate goal objective of an evolved behavioral system is tantamount
to present-day physicists attempting to analyze the physical universe without einstein's equation
e equals m c squared the theory of relativity indeed in the final analysis and evolved
behavioral system is also a system of energy in specific energy pattern configurations no less than the physical
universe is a system of energy and specific energy pattern configurations once the concept of a unified field
theory of behavior or evolved system of behavior is understood adequately
all major behavioral patterns that develop within the total behavior system context are seen as be having both
meaning and function within the total behavioral system thus these behavioral patterns partially
express and eventually achieve the ultimate goal objective
today smoking or the oral use of smoking objects is a major pattern of people behavior in the dominant
behavioral system on earth 688 billion cigarettes were manufactured
in the u.s alone in 1976. 53 million americans adults smoke some
form of tobacco 89 000 americans die annually from lung cancer
and which is approximately 244 persons dying each day from this ravaging disease yet since
1964 when the surgeon general's report first linked cigarette smoking with disease there was been a smoking controversy
among americans for and against smoking the above facts and health statistics alone
which do not include the number of deaths caused by fire through the mishandling of smoking objects could make everyone
alert to and curious about the behavioral pattern of smoking and the causes of the behavior pattern
this essay seeks to pinpoint the perhaps unconscious but major underlying determinants of this
behavioral pattern that heretofore have not been understood or probed adequately
by elevating the level of insight into the behavioral pattern in its causes conscious control over the behavior
pattern may be enhanced and the incident of smoking may decrease as i've stated previously
the existing global behavior system culture of racism white supremacy is the sum total of the conscious and
unconscious patterns of symbols logic thought speech action dreams emotional response and perception
it includes the tactics strategies and methodologies evolved from the global white collective in all areas of people
activity which is economics education entertainment labor law politics religion sex and war
to resolve the psycho psychological anxiety and tensions related to the threat to white genetic survival now beyond
this resolution of this anxiety intention is the ultimate goal objective of preventing the ever-present threat
to white genetic survival from ever becoming a reality this task requires constant and
continuous vigilance by all members of the white collective however because of the minority status
of the white collective on the planet and because of its genetic recessive status relative to the skin melanated
global majority there exists in a collective white psyche a profound sense of genetic and
therefore genital weakness and inadequacy because it is males who are physically
and psychologically responsible for the initiation of the act of self reproduction and self production
it is the white male in the white collective who most greatly senses consciously or unconsciously and
experiences genetic and genital inadequacy this is attested to strongly by the white males and indeed
the total white collectives continuously prevailing concerned with who has the largest penis the black male or the white male indeed large numbers
of white males today are preoccupied and concerned that their penises are too small such a concern being reflected of the
sense of genital and genetic inadequacy black males are not preoccupied similarly see chapter seven
that the darker male is viewed as more powerful and most more substantially virile and masculine in the white
supremacy system culture is again attested to by the fact that the white females idealize male as described
by the white collective as tall dark and handsome the word dark does indeed refer to a higher level
level of melanin skin pigmentation and hair pigmentation the importance of the dark man
as a symbol of genital and genetic inadequacy is the white supremacy system culture was the basis for the crowd drawing power
and significance of two of the most important movie heroes of the last century in the u.s rudolf
valentino and elvis presley the case of presley removes all doubt from my thesis because
his style of singing and moving his genitals area was restricted was strictly copied as best he could from black male singers
in the case of valentino two of his most important roles in the movies the sheik and the son of the sheik wherein he
played non-white north african men or arabs subsequently a very popular condom
was brand named chic valentino also portrayed the more his great appeal to the white
female and male was that he was dark and made up to appear even darker supposedly he was also a master lover
yet another instance of the most important of the importance of black as a symbol of male genital and general
and genetic adequacy is the fact that the standard wedding attire for the white male and
western white culture is black and in the most formal weddings males wear black tails while the bride
wears white when dressed for most other important social occasions the white male
similarly dresses in black tails and black tie although the tails hung in the back they
remain phallic symbols similarly ties also usually dark colored are phallic symbols and behavioral
system culture that believe that clothes make demand the implication is that the mother nature in the case of the albinos failed
in some respect white males also believe that they look more virile and attractive when suntanned or brown and bronzed
this belief is maintained despite the fact that each year in the us alone there are 300 000 new cases of skin cancer caused
primarily by whites attempting to tan their pale skin into greater attractiveness in this way
area of the world white males also have a had a long nefarious history of lynching and castrating black males and taking their
genitals as well as other parts home has prized and desired souvenirs to be possessed symbolically
making them their own just as the important ball games fall into a two series large black brown large black and brown
and small white all major smoking of objects in the white supremacy culture fall into the same two categories
large brown cigars and pipes and small white cigarettes furthermore the ball games
played by the supposedly most more virile men entailed the use of large brown balls while the smoking objects chosen by
those men who wish to view themselves and be viewed as powerful viral and important are large brown smoking objects cigars mainly
but also pipes the late british prime minister winston churchill was estimated
to have smoked three hundred thousand eight or nine inch double coronas john f kennedy also was reported to have
loved havana cigars and fidel castro who considers himself to be white is never seen without a long cigar in
his mouth whereas i maintain that the brown and white balls used in ball games and white supremacy culture are symbols of the
black and white testicles respectively i maintain further that the brown and white smoking objects are
similarly symbols of the black and white phallus or penis together the balls in the ball game and
the smoking objects constitute a highly important symbol package of the complete male genitalia
the penis and testicles the white supremacy system culture is preoccupied most fundamentally not
with profit but with its genetic and genetical status and survival on the planet it is only
logical and since this great survival concern is not discussed at the culture's conscious level
it manifests another major behavioral activity within the system culture albeit largely at an unconscious level
thus it is not surprising that these two important black and white symbol series balls and smoking objects should be a
central preoccupation they cannot be curtailed in spite of the violence in ball games and the cancer associated with smoking
the white supremacy system culture is dominated by white males however white males still experience a
deep sense of male genital and genetic deficiency and inadequacy this is due to the fact that white males
fear genetic annihilation by men of color thus major activity of the part of white males via system
culture they established consists of the unconscious drive and desire to boost or supplement the level of one's maleness
or masculinity and to internalize more male principle element or substance by any means
possible the sense of deficiency in male principle also may be expressed in terms
of sensed inadequacy and therefore dependency and male principle dependency need gratification in other words in a
culture and behavioral system where the most dominant feature is a sense of male genital and genetic inadequacy
on part of albino males the attempt to compensate for this sense deficiency most certainly will be manifested in
some manner and patterns of behavior the habitual pattern of placing the symbolic phallus or penis in the oral
cavity is one example of symbolic compensation for sense male genetic and genital inadequacy smoking as previously
stated is placing a symbolic phallus in the oral cavity as a means of again internalizing more masculinity as the
penis is that which most obviously makes the male a male
male homosexual acts of placing the penis in the rectum or in the oral cavity also achieved symbolically
the result of internalizing and ingesting through a gastrointestinal tract opening male substance in this instance
what is internalized is the ejaculate which parallels the inhalation of smoke and the swallowing
of saliva when mouthing a cigar or pipe it should be noted here that in the 1960s when black people behind
male leadership began to challenge the white supremacy status quo and cries of black power there was an increase in the
number of cigars imported to the u.s cigars cigar imports more than doubled
from 30 million to 80 million per year between 1967 and 1974.
large numbers of people also began to smoke small long dark brown cigarettes an
interesting mythology surrounds a cigar during their manufacture these smoking objects are hand wrapped
while held between the legs of cuban non-white women its reference to the proximity of the cigar
the smoking brown object and phallic symbol to the non-white female's genital anatomy supports my contention of the symbolic
function the cigar plays in the fantasy of the white male psyche here one is also reminded of the
underground saying in a white male coach that one is not a man until he has had sexual intercourse with a black female
meaning until he has demonstrated that his white phallus is inadequate as that of the black male understanding
the above symbolism will explain further an advertisement for more cigarettes printed in december 19 1976
issue of the new york times magazine which reads as follows why isn't more white because more is
burnish brown to make it longer leaner design look as good as it looks as good as it tastes
and when it comes to the taste of more you can enjoy its smooth mildness longer because more burns slower so more
doesn't end with just good looks there's lots of good taste as well it's like any really good cigarette
only it's more this ad carries an even greater significance because of the great emphasis placed on oral sex by the
white supremacy system culture in contrast to behaviors of non-white peoples this ad also must be seen
in the context of the epidemic of pornographic magazines that place heavy emphasis on black males as objects of oral sex for both white
males and females the above ad also follows and allows the following question to be raised
is the brand name more a substitute for more with the above interpretation of symbols
in the context of the white supremacy system culture it becomes increasingly apparent that there cannot be a ban on cigarette
smoking in spite of its cancer-causing potential if indeed the basic dilemma in the white supremacy system
and culture is genetic and genetic inadequacy and the objects of an acts of symbolic of ingesting more
phallus were banned what behavioral substitutes would be suggested that could could solve the basic anxiety provoking dilemma of white
genetic annihilation perhaps genital transplant surgery from black males to white males
hopefully not frank cannibalism in chapter eight i discussed the gun as
a symbol in the white supremacy system culture i demonstrated that the gun similarly cannot be banned because it is symbolic
fowler's substitute for the white male the white male's penis and testicles genetically cannot annihilate black
and other non-white males but his gun can therefore to ban the gun for the white male is to castrate him
symbolically to remove his defense mechanism for the ever-present threat of white genetic annihilation
we're now in a position to understand the inadequately explained and inadequately understood
concepts of penis envy castration anxiety and castration complex all key concepts in the freudian
psychoanalytic edifice these concepts take on valid applicability in the context of the white supremacy
system culture and that they can all relate to anxieties fears and tensions of the dominant members of the white supremacy
culture the white males and then project these tensions and fears in their various and sundry forms onto others
white females and black and other non-white males and females
in reality it is the white male who basically envies the genital power and genetic status of black and other
non-white males and without his guns or other weapons the white male feels castrated in the
presence of black males and females and all other non-white people
castration anxiety which ford inadequately assumed had meaning only in the family context now
can be understood as the basic fear in the global white supremacy system of white genetic annihilation
the sphere has been evolving in magnitude since albinos or whites were first developed as genetic mutants from
blacks in africa many thousands of years ago only a short period of time in the context of the 3.5 million years that
black people have been on earth the global white supremacy system is the evolved methodology of
compensation for white male castration fears and anxiety of the fear of white genetic annihilation based upon white
genetic insufficiency this essay illuminates the major fallacy in the western pattern of
perception and thought failure to be able to recognize and decode the whole western perceptions are unfortunately
limited and fragmented tending towards ever higher levels of abstraction and isolation of
what has been abstracted but never fully and consciously perceiving what has been abstracted in relationship to the whole
guns are always seen in the isolated abstraction as are balls and smoking objects
this failure if not refusal to precede the whole is a result of the repressed conceptualization of the white self as
the albino mutant fragments of the whole offspring from black hole progenitors thus there is an
inability to place the white self in a total perspective of the human family and the totality of the universe without
the admission of the genetic defective status of skin whiteness the white collective therefore must deny
the meaning and reality of africa as its own birthplace and the point of origin of its own
civilization the isis papers chapter 12 black fear
Chapter 12 - PAGES 153-162
and the failure of black analytical ideological commitment it is known an
extremely high level of fear and profound sense of vulnerability of existence can lead the human brain computer into
ineffectual patterns of circular thought in such cases problems perceived are avoided and never solved
this is in direct contrast to effective patterns of direct linear thought that move continuously forward in straight line
progress from problem perception and depth analysis the proposed conclusive modes
of problem solution this holds for individuals as well as collectives and the sense of powerlessness evolves
out of fear and vulnerability and with its imposed patterns of circular as opposed to linear thought
sets the stage for mental behavioral and emotional illness which is always seen at levels of
increased incidence amongst oppressed populations circular thought means moving from
problem perception away from problem solution down a diversionary path
and back again to problem perception this may then be followed by worrying and obsessive complaining
there is never consistent motion toward problem solution because to do so would challenge and
alter the power dynamic of oppression thus high level fear is set in motion
circular thought describes a short circuiting of logic networks in the brain computer an organ which has evolved by nature as
a problem-solving instrument linear thoughts suggest movement from problem perception progressively
towards problem solution changing step by step whatever needs to be altered to achieve total problem solution
utilizing whatever means necessary to achieve this end this form of thought is consistent with
the function and structure of the brain as a problem-solving organ in the human organism now black people throughout the world
live under the power of the white supremacy system of a total oppression and domination implying the absence of any true power
to determine ultimately what happens in their individual and collective lives this is the major
and only problem facing black and all other non-white peoples throughout the world this is precisely why they are called
and classified as black and non-white to set them specifically in oppositional contrast to and in conflict with the
genetic reality of white but because this is a frightening and painful reality upon
which to focus black and other non-white attention we as blacks particularly in the us succumb
to circular thought likewise there's not only a failure to approach problem solution
but there is a stubborn refusal even to look directly at the problem ultimately there is a disturbance in
problem perception therefore black people in the u.s reject the conscious recognition of the global white supremacy system
its absolute necessity of non-white oppression and its very specific implications of a
continuing powerlessness and potential destruction as opposed to a natural death
for blacks and other designated non-whites jonestown guyana is an outstanding example of
destruction that blacks fear under the existing white supremacy system now in 1979
close to one thousand blacks from the us were relocated to jonestown and then murdered under nazi
concentration camp conditions through a process controlled by white people
this extermination center was set up with the full knowledge of the segments of the u s government it is thus no accident that the year
1979 gives further witness to the near total collapse and loss amongst blacks
individually as well as collectively of the ability to effectively perceive analyze and propose solutions to the
problem of white supremacy and its implications for continuing black powerlessness and social disintegration in brief it is
clear in 1979 21 short years before the year 2000 that there is no commitment by blacks to
analyze of the problem of white supremacy comprehensively blacks are without a perception of
analysis of racism or of a scientific counter-racism blacks therefore do not know
what to do with themselves thus we are witnessing a collective black floundering of an ideological
vacuum and disorientation all that remains is for blacks to escalate tragically their activity
a powerless arguing and squabbling amongst themselves and to compete with one another for white supremacy jobs and
grants crumbs or blacks can pretend as a diversionary thought strategy
that the real struggle exists between imagined black classes or between black males and females
every energy and psychological effort is expended at both the individual and collective levels to black out
and avoid focusing on the true problem of white black confrontation white supremacy all blacks realize
consciously and or unconsciously that to engage in such a realistic focus can mean certain death
at the hands of white supremacists the total black collective in the u.s has yet to confront
consciously the mind-blowing logic and thought distorting shock and fear that satan following the assassinations of
practically all courageous blackmail leaders malcolm x martin luther king jr whitney young medgar evers and fred hampton
and then the holocaust of jonestown guyana which many conscious blacks accept as a
planned government action since all these deliberate deaths have occurred there has been a profound
disinclination by surviving blacks to confront the awesome and murderous reality of white supremacy
directly the struggle for justice and true black power now is perceived through a glass
darkly and not face to face because there is overwhelming fear in spite of their superficial
differences the various analysis of the black problem by aforementioned men if carried through their ultimate implications all lead
ultimately to an eventual neutralization of white power control since the demise of these black men who
all were aware of the necessity to resist and destroy white supremacy the remaining rhetoric coming from our black
collective is consistent with submission to and or cooperation with the racist
oppressive dynamic albeit within historical and continuing chorus of complaints
this behavior of submission to in cooperation with white supremacy is consistent with the illusion that there
can be a complete integration of non-whites into the white supremacy system in contrast to these modes and thoughts
of action the black men cited above are examples of resistance to and destruction
of white supremacy as an absolute form of injustice these latter forms of behavior require
high levels of self and group respect and can be sustained only when there is a willingness to give
one's life for the achievement of justice as each of these men demonstrated
however it has been demonstrated by the aforementioned man that the almost certain consequence of a pattern of consciously determined
resistance to and destruction of white supremacy is death at the hands of white supremacy advocates
those who see and understand white supremacy as necessary to white survival even young black children are able to
perceive and articulate that if you try to help black people you will be killed
when i ask a 10 year old black boy don't you want to study hard in school so that you can help black people he immediately answered no giving the
above explanation the chill of this reality inherent in the maintenance of white supremacy does not escape black children
and it mostly most certainly does not escape their elders although the latter are more sophisticated and
no better than to admit the same openly this fear of death at the hands of white supremacy collective because it cannot
be admitted aloud by the adult black population has been repressed the result of covering the fear has been
the emergence of the sick protective logic that there is no longer a problem of white supremacy
except in england perhaps or in south africa southern africa for blacks in the u.s all of that has
been solved additionally there is a claim that the only remaining stresses are blacks rejecting other blacks be it male
versus female and female versus male female versus female and male versus male or to
fantasize black middle class versus the fantasized black lower class of course the fact is that class does
not refer to income alone but to actual existing power and since blacks across the board are
oppressed and powerless under white supremacy none of us have power therefore
there are no classes among blacks but to return to the issue of black defensive logic
these patterns of logic which emphasize that the existing problems are mainly between blacks are reflective of black self-hate the
self-hatred is escalated and reinforced by increasing black suicide black on black homicide
children abu child abuse and spouse abuse in addition to the aforementioned non-productive behaviors there are also
increasing patterns of behavior that can be described as inducing semi-trance states such as rhythmic hand clapping singing and
dancing excessive rock music playing listening to radio music and shouting in religious settings these
patterns of behavior are manifested continually by black people to pitch themselves into possible altered cortical brain states likewise
such brain states seem to have the effect of dampening the sense of an overwhelming external pain
or danger over which blacks conceive we have no control these practices of course avoid problem
confrontation and thereby prevent problem solution
similarly the increase in interracial marriages can be viewed as a means of escape and a means for blacks to avoid
the awareness of their continuing status as permanent outsiders outside of the white
chalk circle of white supremacy's numerical and genetic global necessity it should be noted that in the white supremacy
societal unit of nazi germany the highest incidence of interracial marriage between semites or non-whites
and germans whites occurred just prior to the ultimate destruction of the semites in the holocaust
the semites of the jewish religion were looked upon as non-whites because their ancestors were black and
resided in africa prior to entering europe see chapter 18. similarly
some blacks have sought to escape the confrontation with white supremacy through marxist doctrine by attempting to
conceive of themselves as members of the working class they fail to see that marx who was a
semite a non-white was a victim of anti-semitism one-third
of the world population of semites of the jewish religion were destroyed by german white supremacy
meaning that millions of marx's own descendants were destroyed in the process still not one word of marx's doctrine
addressed itself to this potential fate of his own group he did not understand that he was being
classified as non-white nor did he understand not white versus non-white color confrontation
thus he was ill-prepared to address it and its destructive implications he too became confused in recognizing
himself as a non-white and a struggle that goes on between the white classes
the upper middle and lower classes now he failed to realize that irrespective of income education and position he and all of the
fellow semites constitute the powerless non-white non-class victim in a white supremacy
system all non-whites then as now fall outside all three of the aforementioned white
class groupings because the word class specifically refers to power ultimately the power to protect one's
life and the lives of one's group members in the framework of an existing power system
this attempted escape into marx's doctrine falsely confronts comfort some blacks as it did many
semites in europe and accepting this doctrine they are convinced that there are some whites
the workers who wish to unite with non-whites out of the supposed common interests
they further believe that these whites do not function under the white supremacy necessity the global fear of white genetic
annihilation by the genetically dominant non-whites that pattern of survival psyche of all
who accept classification as white people though they have no proof that a significant number of such whites exist
some blacks persist in following the marxist doctrine in order to avoid the fear-induced awareness that blacks and
other non-whites are and always have been weak and invulnerable to the context of a global white supremacy system
like the ten-year-old black male child i mentioned earlier all black adults will have to learn how to admit openly and
honestly their fear of dying in the process of actively destroying the injustice of global white supremacy
only then will black brain computers cease patterns of circular logic the logic of fear and escape such that a
firm black analysis of white supremacy dynamic can develop with this established and long-term
commitment to white supremacy neutralization can follow a prerequisite to overcoming fear is the
growth of self and group respect disrespect cannot be developed as black strive to
blame one another for the symptoms of the common oppression disrespect cannot flourish in
the presence of a belief that blacks cannot develop their own analysis of and provide their own solutions to black
problems without the leadership approval and or funding of non-blacks in keeping
with this globalist goal i recommend to the black collective that we need not have any conferences other
than to announce the existence of our fear of white supremacy and to share with one another all
possible solutions for overcoming these fears solving the problem of political
and social oppression of a people is fundamentally no different than solving a problem of illness in the
human body what is essential in the latter instance and is an accurate diagnosis of the problem
through observation examination in various clinical tests and studies
the diagnosis represents a summarized statement of the specific pattern of psych physiologic derangement and a statement
of the major and minor causal factors a problem a program of treatment and
cure is based upon producing the specific measures to counteract the casual factors efficiently and alter
any potential for the return of any of those factors permanently finally the test of diagnostic accuracy
is the effectiveness of the treatment and cure the physician functions as a scientist
to the extent that he or she bases the plan of treatment and cure on concrete observation
examination and analysis of the problem this physician scientist is more dependent upon his or her current
observations and analysis than upon some previously written descriptions of similar disease states
found in some valued textbook written by learned and respected ancient
the authorities or scientist is ever cognizant of the possibility of new disease states that never existed previously or of old
disease states that never were described accurately and thus for which there are no established patterns of plans for
treatment and cure physicians who lack fundamental self-respect and self-confidence
are unable to make their own observations and analysis because they do not trust their own sensory apparatus
nor do they trust the ability of their own brain computers to make accurate
correlations of the incoming sensory data therefore they will be incompetent in
observing and treating new problems and they will be unable to perform adequately in the managing in the management of new very
variations seen in previously recognized disease processes external environmental dynamics which
affect the body and health and of and disease are changing constantly causing new and different
pictures of disease states the major factor in diagnosis is the ability of the physician
scientists to make his or her own observations and for the brain to make critical analyses
of the data and observation which is experience this series of acts observation
experience and analysis then becomes the basis for all follow-up activity in treatment and problem
solution in summary the physician scientists begin and beginning with his or her
observations works on to uncover the courses of disease through knowledge of the specific disease process he or she works to
affect treatment and cure just as a physician scientist has to face the problem of physical disease
black people and their scientists have to face the problem and solve the problem of black
oppression under white supremacy in fact black people seeking a scientific approach to the problem
similarly must begin acting as scientists observing their situation
recording their own data and following up with their own analysis of the observations experience and data their own analysis
will then inform them of what it is that they as black people need to do to achieve their goal objectives
to the extent that we fail to make our own fundamental observations and to validate our own sensory experience we can conclude that
blacks lack the necessary levels of self-respect and self-confidence needed for independent functioning
to the extent that we believe we cannot depend 100 percent upon our own sensory apparatus we fail
to have confidence in our ability to make encompassing analyses and to that same extent we're forced
into dependency upon those whose brain computer we believe to be superior to our own if we do not
have confidence our ability to make independent black observations black analysis and black plans for black
action why should we talk about or seek black liberation one
never should seek independence from those upon whom one feels permanently dependent for that would be an act of suicide
and indeed if that independence were one it soon would be returned to the former state of dependence
furthermore if we believe that we are intellectually inferior to white people as our distrust of our capacity to
observe and make correlations would strongly imply we simply should say this out loud for
all the world to hear blacks are genetically inferior in terms of their intellectual capacity as
compared to the white counterparts then we should content ourselves quietly and politely to be totally and
permanently dependent upon the white collective for all that we need do think and say if it's if black
behavioral social and political scientists are supposed to be incapable of making accurate analysis of behavior social and
political situations local and worldwide that black physicians are also incapable
of making accurate medical diagnoses and all black patients should seek white doctors this would imply similarly
that black lawyers are incapable of successfully handling legal cases and all black law clients
should seek white lawyers likewise all black students should seek white teachers furthermore all black
women seeking husbands should seek white husbands and all black men seeking wives should seek
white wives this activity would carry such reasoning to its logical though absurd conclusions
if you do not wish to imply all of the above let us get about our business of black problem solving
beginning with the problem of black oppression under white supremacy first and foremost let it be the
responsibility of every black person to know and understand how the dynamic of white supremacy domination
is expressed in all areas of people activity economics education entertainment labor law
politics religion sex and war

the isis papers chapter 13 the concept and the color of god and black mental health agnostics doubt
and question the existence of god atheists deny the existence of god these
two groups combined constitute a tiny minority of the world's people the vast and overwhelming majority of the peoples on earth have a
conceptualization of and believe in the existence of god no matter how named or defined as a supreme force
or supreme being responsible for the creation of the universe therefore the supreme being constitutes
the highest and ultimate focus of their worship devotion and obedience in all but the agnostic
and atheist groups but the training and teaching of children about the concept of god in a given culture
begin at the earliest possible age of comprehension and understanding customarily long before children are
capable of understanding any philosophical and abstract consideration of god they're exposed to the system of
rituals that the given people have evolved over thousands of years the rituals form a part of the
recognition of worship of and obedience to the concepts of god this long before there is true cognitive
understanding there is participation in the practice of recognizing god this participation in practice becomes a
part of children's and ultimately adults concept and cell image of self in relationship to the total environment
but also in relationship to the highest and ultimate focus of their worship devotion and obedience to the god of the
people for it is the totality of experience in the environment for the moment of birth that forms a self-image and
self-concept in the brain computer of each human being from this image and self-image and self-concept
all patterns of behavior evolve likewise from the entire constellation of behavior in the individual
the determination of mental health or mental illness is made as a practicing general and child
psychiatrist my definition of mental health is as follows patterns of logic thought speech action
and emotional response in all areas of people activity that simultaneously reflect self and group respect and respect for
harmony in the universe the critical question that arises now is what does the concept
and color of god have to do with black self and group respect and respect for harmony in the universe
the oppression of black and other non-white people means that there is not no non-white self-determination
it also means most fundamentally that there can be no true and functional black self-respect
more specifically this means that the existing levels of non-white functional self-respect as manifested in all areas
of people activity are extremely low thus these low levels of functional self-respect
imply that the self-image and self-concept are more negative than positive likewise the impact of
non-white individual collective behavior in and on the total environment is more negative than positive
to have a negative impact on the total environment is a manifestation of behavioral powerlessness to have a
negative impact on the total environment is a manifestation of the self-image and self-concept as powerless to have a negative impact on
the total environment is a manifestation of having been shaped and molded by the total environment into a functional inferior
to the process of inferiorization the process of oppression is to mold the victims of oppression
into functional inferiors as previously stated the global system
of white supremacy oppression functions through all areas of people activity the ultimate thrust towards the victims
of oppression and all of the nine areas of people activity is to cause and affect their universalizing
this is achieved equally in the area of religion as in sex is achieved equally in area of war as in
economics it is achieved equally in entertainment as in labor it is achieved equally in politics as in law
in other words all nine areas of people activity are used equally in a system of non-white oppression to achieve the ultimate goal
of non-white inferiorization the concept and color of god are focused on most strongly
in the area of religion although all areas of people activity overlap influence and fuse with one another the
global white supremacy system evolved a religion referred to as christianity however it
is referred to most appropriately as the dominant pattern of religious thought generated by the white supremacy system
similarly all forms of economics within the global white supremacy system whether referred to as capitalism
multinationalism communism or socialism are identified more appropriately as the patterns of
economic thought and practice generated by that system further all forms of political
organization within the global white supremacy system whether referred to as democracy nazism soviet hegemony fascism
and nationalism are referred to more appropriately as the various patterns of power relationships generated by that
system absolutely critical to the white supremacy system of religious thought was the formation of the image of the
white man as the son of god this white male image then was referred
to as christ no matter that the prophet jesus was a black man because the brain computer functions
most fundamentally on logic circuits at deep unconscious levels it automatically computes that god
the father is also a white male if god is other than white he would have produced a black or non
other non-white sun see diagram three does any person programmed to accept the christian
religion whether conscious of it or not has the image and the concept of god as a white man
in a logic network of his or her brain computer couple this image and concept of god as
a white man with the white supremacy system's formal definition of god as a supreme or ultimate reality
the being perfect in power wisdom and goodness whom men worship as creator and ruler of the universe then of absolute necessity the
logic and circuits of the human brain computer have to print out the white man as god the father of the white male
christ is a supreme or ultimate reality the white man is the being
perfect in power wisdom and goodness whom all men should worship as creator and ruler of the universe
with this unconscious logic circuit of god is a white man firmly in place white domination over
non-white people could last for one trillion years this would be true if the critical and essential
logic connection could be implanted and plugged into the brain computers of sufficient number of black brown red and yellow peoples who constitute the vast
majority of peoples on the planet with the white man as god the non-white global collective
would be obedient to the white man always it was the necessary duty of the vast army of white supremacy
christians minister or missionaries sent out around the world following the guns of
white supremacy conquest to implant deep within the unconscious logic networks of non-white brain computers
the critical image and concept of god as a white man this unconscious implantation has been
successful to the extent that many non-white people on the planet conceive of themselves as members of the christian white supremacy
religion in the u.s the overwhelming majority of black people as well as a large portion of other non-white peoples consider
themselves christians thus all black and other non-white peoples who profess to be members of the
christian white supremacy religion whether they are conscious of it or not worship the white man as god
not as a god but as the god and in the unconscious logic network of
their individual brain computers lies a logic that the white man is the supreme or ultimate reality
the being perfect in power wisdom and goodness who men worship as creator and ruler of the universe
although black and other non-white peoples may understand that they are oppressed by the global white collective of which the white males are the
dominant members the brain computer's cold logic circuits also unconsciously inform the non-white
christian victim that it is impossible to free or liberate oneself from the supreme being who has
created the universe in other words if in the deep unconscious recesses of my brain
computer rest the fundamental logic that god is a white man and that i should worship god all of my attempts at
liberation will only move me in a circle indeed the circumference of my liberation movement circle
could be so wide that it really appears to me that i am moving in a straight line of progress but moving in a circle no matter how big
the circle is tantamount to standing absolutely still marking time many black people in the us now are
beginning to feel as though our liberation efforts in spite of the loss of life and whipped heads have left us still
standing on the same spot of white oppression for the vast majority of black and other non-white peoples today the arrival of
these ice cold facts of brain computer logic at the conscious level will be experienced
initially as shattering and self disintegrating primarily because it is god the protector and god and the
creator upon whom the self is taught programmed ultimately to depend
if the concept of god is removed from my brain computer found whom am i to lean especially if i
am feeling oppressed depressed and overwhelmed if there is nothing or no one to provide support then i believe
that i will collapse and disintegrate nonetheless as a general and child psychiatrist i'm fully aware of
the destruction spawned by the unconscious logic implant god is a white man however no matter
what the level of initial trauma felt when this logic circuit is brought to conscious awareness it must come fully
to light and be yanked out indeed there could be no mental health self-respect or positive self-concept
for black or other non-white peoples as long as this spacious and destructive logic circuit remains in
place it might be instructed at this juncture to recall that christianity
was based upon the life and activity of an african black prophet named jesus that the white romans recognized
as fact is reflected in the early portrayals of jesus and his mother as the black madonna and a black child to this day the
picture of a black madonna and black child secretly is cherished as one of the most holy icons of the original christian church
the catholic church what then necessitated changing the image of black jesus and black mary to white create christ
and white mary to answer this question we must return to the most fundamental fact in the existence of the global white collective
white skinned peoples initially were the mutant albino of black peoples in africa these
white-skinned people are recognized as having a disease just as today's modern science of genetics refers to the condition of
albinism the lack of melanin pigmentation as a genetic deficiency disease
the white skin early albinos were rejected by the normal pigmented majority they were chased out and isolated from
the normal black genetic groupings eventually they had to migrate northward to remove themselves from the intense
african sun rays migrating northward from africa the albino populations eventually settled in
the area of the world now referred to as euro there they increased in number and eventually
returned to conquer the peoples of color in africa asia and the rest of the world they
returned with the idea that they would conquer and no longer think of themselves as rejected and diseased population instead
they would think of themselves in compensation as the superior and supreme superman and look upon all skin-pigmented peoples as
the genetic inferiors necessary the necessity for such a
confidence compensatory ideology and concept of self as superior the white psyche could tolerate no concept
of anything higher than the white self not even god thus when the concept
of the son of god was formulated in their thinking the son eventually took the form of a white man
which by brain computer logic would mean that god himself had to be a white man thus the white collective in logical
reality is not in worship of any force beyond itself further
it is apparent that the collective white psyche felt anger towards god for bequeathing them that what is now
understood as a genetic defect named white skin in turn they have spawned a thinking that
doubts and denies the existence of god thus they have conceived of themselves as being at war with nature
which is a reflection of god they function as though they are in context with god and try to out-create god presently they are
on the cusp to produce genes and life itself in fact their dominant occupation is the destruction of the universe and it is
that no accident that within the language system of the most highly evolved white supremacy unit the word god is the exact mirror image
of the word dog and within the same language system the dog not god is said to be man's best
friend blacks and other non-white peoples who have operated under the concept of god as a white man for the past two thousand
years should begin an immediate return to the fundamental concept of god as originally understood in africa
before the input of the albino white collective the african understanding of god was
that it was only an all-in-one energy force that created and simultaneously was
all energy in the universe this understanding recognized the god force as the source of all
the being responsible for all and the multiplicity of energy configurations in the universe
furthermore the belief held that there are no energy configurations in the universe that they are not from god and that are
not god it was the african way to respect completely the source of all energy manifest and
responsible for all things this is african spirituality spirit is energy spirituality is the
ability to get in touch with not only the ultimate source of all energy but also the various multiplicity
of energy configurations which include matter plants animals etc this
was for africans the essential cosmic connection the power connection since melanin is a
superior absorber of all energy it is essential to establish this understanding of god and all energy
the fact that the albinos or whites like melanin may also help to explain why they have quite a difficult and
different concept of understanding of god all energy or all spirit why they conceive of a trinity and why
in the view of many non-white peoples they add they the whites lack spirituality and its capacity to tune in to
and thereby establish harmony and justice in the universe further because they lack the melanin
sensory system they cannot intuit all that at once
however at some unconscious level there must be within the collective white psyche the awareness
that the color black is essential to be in touch with the god for us justice and wisdom and that is why they
clothe their men and who are supposed to have knowledge of justice in black and they clothe their scholars
at the point of their scholastic wisdom achievement in black academic robes of course one might cite a few
exceptions but black for ministers priests judges and scholars as the norm in the white supremacy system culture
worldwide i recommend that black and other non-white peoples begin to practice consciously removing
the white image of son of god from their brain computers and thus removing the corollary logic that god is a white man
secondly blacks and other non-white peoples must practice utilizing our particular energy crystallizations or
bodies as direct connections with the god force this means we must learn to use our energy crystallization antenna
to connect with the source from which all energy flows is the same as unplugging an electric
cord into a wall socket by so learning to tune into the cosmic energy source
it is possible to find the cosmic purpose of one's particular energy configuration known as one's body then it would be will be
possible to use that cosmic energy for constructive purposes i can say no more about how it can be
done but only that it can be done just as i am saying that it is possible to break the logic circuit god is a
white man in the non-white brain computer to be black and accept consciously or
unconsciously the image of god as a white man is the highest possible form of self-negation and lack of self-respect under these
specific conditions of white domination such perception emotional response and
thought are therefore insane this logic circuit ensures that black people always look up to white
people and therefore down upon themselves only by breaking that logic circuit can
the concept of black and other non-white liberation become a reality this is the direction in which we blacks
must propel ourselves as we enter the 21st century

the isis papers chapter 14 the symbolism and meaning of rape october 1980 the symbol consists of
multiple levels of energy data the hieroglyphs higher writings or writings concerning multiple levels of
energy data are written symbolic thought and language similarly the parable is a statement of
combined multiple levels of energy data it is also a statement of symbolic thought
part of our ancient heritage as black african people is the knowledge of the symbol this working knowledge includes the
ability to speak write and decode symbolic language and thought melanin is essential for
having deep knowledge of the symbol because melanin is capable of absorbing a broad spectrum of energy frequencies
or data black is considered to be a perfect absorber of energy there are innumerable facts that support
this assertion for example osiris the great egyptian african god was referred to as lord of the perfect black
albert einstein's great work on energy was based upon earlier knowledge and physics of the so-called black box
energy absorption and mission experiments black holes in cosmic space are so named because of
their great power to absorb all forms of energy persons lacking high levels of melanin
pigmentation in the nervous system which includes the skin as its outermost manifestation have great difficulty in
absorbing energy data from the universe at multiple frequencies deep energy levels therefore these
white-skinned peoples the founders of western civilization and culture experience great difficulty in
understanding and decoding the symbol this is the most fundamental reason that westerners have
difficulty in thinking like easterners black and brown peoples people with higher levels of melanin in
the nervous system and vice versa melanated people are functioning with a sixth sense
and the additional sensory system being that of melanin pigmentation while westerners function with only five
senses thus the western dictionaries define hieroglyphs as difficult to decipher similarly the
western dictionaries define parable as an obscure or enigmatic saying black and other non-white peoples
who have been trained to think like westerners now have to retrain their brains and nervous system to function at
full capacity through conscious effort to use their melanin networks this can be achieved through the
practice of self-respect wearing black and other non-white people's respect and pay close attention to what their own sixth
sense nervous systems inform them of this is quite contrary to focusing on what white skinned peoples are able to
focus on and what they train non-white people to focus on
melanin deficient educators can train non-white people to use only a portion of their nervous systems at best thus it
is the responsibility of non-white peoples to take charge of developing the full use of the melanin
potential familiarity with these issues are necessary for an examination of rape as a symbol in the white supremacy
system culture rape is an unjust and sick pattern of behavior it is a behavior pattern reflective of
very low levels of self-respect and therefore of mental illness simultaneously rape manifests very low
levels of respect toward others it is a horrendous violation of the selfhood of another
the most frequent form of raping is that in which a male aggressively and abusively imposes his genitals onto a
female with the threat of destruction this conduct is seen most frequently in situation of
male confinement in penal institutions juvenile corrective institutions or psychiatric institutions which are
staffed and supervised inadequately a fundamental aspect of rape is the imposition of the male genitals upon
someone considered physically weaker or vulnerable by someone who at least superficially looks
upon himself as being more powerful and capable of subduing another condensed to the least
common denominator rape is an act in which the genitals become a weapon a weapon is most fundamentally
an instrument of aggression and is conceived of as an aid to the human body when the body alone is considered
inadequate for the task of subduing and conquering in today's world rape is common
in the u.s it is reported in highest incidents among members of the black population with
black males raping black females they were said to be an approximately equal incidence of white males raping black
females as black males raping white females the incidence of white males raping white females is
lowest in past decades white male rape of black females was of highest incidence instead of breaking
into hysteria of the women's liberation movement regarding the issue of rape i prefer to examine the meaning of this behavior
commencing with male use of male genitalia as i have stated in all of my writings
during the past 10 years there is no behavior that can be adequately understood and decoded outside the context
of the power relationships that exist among people in today's world the most fundamental of
all power relationships is that of white power versus non-white black brown red and
yellow powerlessness the underlying factors and forces have led to the evolution of the specific
power system are one the numerical minority status of white skin peoples globally
and two the fact that white skin is genetically recessive to the dominant genetic potential to produce melanin if white skin peoples
had not evolved a global system in which they established power over the world's non-white majority
the white collective would run the risk of white genetic annihilation the fear of such annihilation has
influenced the white collective to evolve over the centuries massive weapon systems
from simple to gross and horrible instruments of destruction and annihilation this was done most
fundamentally to equalize the genetic power for white collective destruction power possessed by the planets men of
color the ability to decode symbols is essential to obtain an accurate understanding of
exactly what is happening in the surrounding environment for example the ability to decode helps
us to understand deeper meanings inherent in the major instruments evolved by the global white collective
to prevent white genetic annihilation and the shaping of such instruments after the form of male genitalia
guns bombs cannons cannonballs airplanes and nuclear missiles it is little wonder
then that the gun has been called the great equalizer or that a white male who is really supposed to be something is
referred to as a pistol at the same time the highest percentage of money expenditure is going
towards the arms race the race for accumulating sufficient weapons by both white superpowers
hopefully sufficient to prevent global white genetic annihilation these weapons surround all of the
world's non-white peoples of course this is not what is said overtly overtly whites claim that the
white superpowers are arming against one another but this is the language of the white lie
the great lie the super or superior lie in the depths of the language itself it
is possible to understand the exact meaning of the arms race the arms race also means the race
genetic group of people whose genetic existence is tied to weapons of violence
arms just as hidden within the word america america is the phrase i am race
thus is the symbolic anagram the whites are the only group on the planet to develop the word
race and they have given the word maximum meaning clearly in the global global white
supremacy system culture the highest percentage of energy is directed towards the construction of weapons
out of a sense of genetic and genital weakness and inadequacy of all the cultures in the world western
white supremacy has the highest level of sensed male inadequacy and male awareness of genetic
and genital vulnerability thus the need for weapons of attack the culture clearly has equated to male
genitals with weapons and aggression as mentioned in chapter 10 the white collective looks upon a
black male specifically as the possessor of the genitals most capable of causing white genetic annihilation
and this explains the expression to black ball which means to exclude from social life thus
in the white supremacy system culture white females have been taught to focus on all black males as
potential rapists at the same time like females are taught to describe the males that they have the
greatest level of sexual attraction for is tall dark and handsome clearly it was no accident that once the
white female began to petition for her liberation from the white male she also began an all-out sexual
aggression towards the black male in particular other non-white males in general unable
to admit her own sexual attractions and aggressions toward the black male consciously she began to talk about developing
anti-rape organizations to prevent rape the projection being that white females
were about to be attacked by black males meanwhile the greatest incidence of rape
was being conducted by black males against black females the above discussion is the best
explanation for the white collectives most specifically the white males collective production of massive numbers
of kinds of weapons of destruction which land on black mother earth
that are symbolic substitutions and substitutes for a genetic and genital apparatus perceived as
inadequate simultaneously it explains the use of male genitals as weapons in the act of rape most
pronouncedly observed in a black male population a population forced into political
power and functional inadequacy by the oppression of white supremacy the weapons produced by the white supremacy
systems are the truly respected male genetic and genital apparatus of the global white collective
these symbolic weapons are perceived as countering the threat of white genetic annihilation by black and other
non-white male genitalia these weapons then are used to rape
and destroy black mother earth just as other technologies of the white supremacy system
culture rape and pollute the planet as a supposed statement of white male adequacy and
power in turn black and other non-white males are forced by the same environment into
thinking of their genital apparatus as destructive weapons of aggression through the act of rape black
males engage in this activity out of their imposed frustration and sense of political powerlessness and inadequacy
non-white male genitals are used as destructive weapons primarily against black and other
non-white females this behavior also can be viewed as paralleling
white male collective sexual attacks on non-white women and a global white collective wars of
domination against non-white people the white male's sense of genetic inadequacy contributed to the white male
collective's need to continue to debase non-white women through rape and other forms of sexual abuse such
abuse was necessary because the white male collective felt debased by the dynamic
the dominant genetic power of non-white women similarly because within the context of
white supremacy more stress and pressure is placed on a black male than on a black female the black male
often perceives that the black female has more power than himself and that she therefore does not respect his manhood
in a sense of inadequacy he strikes out in the rape of the black female seeking to debase her to the level to
which he feels debased under the power system of white domination
although there is no overt discussion of these dominant logic and thought sequences they nonetheless act
as powerful determiners of behavior patterns as seen in white and black populations
however because there is no overt discussion of them these behaviors have not come under conscious control wherein
people consciously can think through their impulses to balance disturbing concepts and images of the male as
inadequate likewise the global white collective and all of its non-white victims in the world see no connection between the
increased incidence of rape and the popularity of singing group that calls itself the sex pistols
thus associating sex with violence the same culture does not see any connection between the numbers and
shape of its missiles bombs guns and male genital genital apparatus and the ever-increasing incidence of
sexual violence the highest level of violence being expressed in the act of rape
in the magazine india today volume 2 number 7 in august 1st to 15th in 1980
the north american edition on one page there was an article on the epidemic of rape in india and on the
very next page there was an article on the development of missiles and other nuclear weapons of destruction by the subcontinent of india
the latter article was entitled soaring into the space age consciously this page and subject
association may be accidental but unconsciously it is logical
india is one of the poorest countries in the world with mass levels of unemployment and starvation
those black and brown men are feeling debased and powerless under global white supremacy
which they still fail to understand after centuries of colonization in india there is a massive mental
disease of people hating their skin color and wishing themselves to be as white as their early white aryan
invaders they are obsessed with the caste system based on skin color with the blackest people looked upon as
untouchables they hate themselves and feel debased under white supremacy also these non-white men have not
discovered yet how to feed their people therefore because of this debased view of self they rape
just as the global white collective has raped the non-white women of the world and continues its rape of black mother
earth with weapons and pollution since the white supremacy system is predicated on
the white collectives most specifically the white male collectives sense of genetic and genital inadequacy and vulnerability it
reflects the sense of inadequacy and vulnerability in the raping of women weaker men and black mother
earth rape is most fundamentally a system a symptom in the entire syndrome of sensed male
inadequacy therefore those who wish to combat the world's epidemic of rape must wage counter struggle against the
global white supremacy system repo cease as a dominant behavior amongst black males once they begin to respect
themselves fully as men cease reacting unconsciously to the white supremacy system's attack against
them and learn to struggle efficiently and effectively to neutralize and destroy
this grave global injustice the isis papers chapter 15 the symbolism

logic and meaning of justifiable homicide in the 1980s where there is no vision the people will
perish proverbs 22 1. black people are afraid but
black people are going to have to get over their fear black people do not know what is happening but black people are going to have to learn and understand
what is happening black people are not thinking but black people are going to have to begin thinking black people are not being
quiet but black people are going to have to start getting quiet so they can think black people are not analyzing and
planning but black people are going to have to begin analyzing and planning black people are do not understand
deep self-respect but black people are going to have to learn the meaning and practice of deep self-respect
black people are going to have to stop permitting black children to play with parenthood like people are going to have to stop
moaning rocking crying and complaining and begging black people are going to have to stop thinking that rhyme and rhetoric will
solve problems black crews are going to have to stop finger popping and singing black people are going to have to stop
dancing and clowning black people are going to have to stop laughing and listening to loud radios
all these behaviors and many more have absolutely nothing to do with addressing the challenges
and conditions of the open warfare continuously being waged against a black collective
we black people do not see the war being waged against us because we don't want to and because we're
afraid we're engaging in behavior designed specifically to block out any awareness
of the war our true reality our behavior thus forces us into the insanity of hoping
and begging as opposed to the sanity of analysis specific behavior pattern design
and specific conduct in all areas of people activity economics education entertainment
labor law politics religion sex and war a major strategy in the war against the
black collective is the killing of black males black males are being killed daily in
ever-increasing numbers across the country others as non-white males also are being killed and never increasing numbers
these black and other non-white males have been killed by white males in uniforms who have been authorized to
carry guns this particular form of murder and slaughter is called justifiable homicide our black
collective today has no greater understanding of this war and phenomenon of justifiable homicide than it did when black males were being
lynched and castrated daily 100 years ago in a period of reconstruction or re-establishment of
white supremacy following a civil war nor does the black collective have a greater understanding of the current
open hunting season on black males and did two and three decades ago because we
really do not understand what is going on in our impotence and ignorance and our powerlessness and frustration we start
getting mad fussing crying rhyming begging with picket signs rioting and
misdirection hooping and hollering moaning in our churches and preparing again to vote for any white
man who smiles at us even though he lies to us these behaviors are all absolutely
useless such behaviors are in vain and will take us nowhere they will all come to naught
and the problem the war will simply continue and intensify the stage has been reached in our
experience of captivity out of africa wherein we are being challenged to demonstrate in deep self-respect requiring us to use
our whole brain computers not just the right side which permits us to engage in rhetoric rhythm and rhyme now
we must begin to exercise and use the left side of our brain computers the left cerebral hemisphere which permits us to analyze critically
and decode what is happening daily in front of our eyes and organize a self and group respecting behavior response
to which the environment is presenting us we must have a discipline self and group respecting response to
the specific war being waged against us without critical thinking however there is no self-respect without self-respect
there is no courage no self-defense no justice no peace no progress in a struggle against white supremacy
the great leader of the chinese-speaking non-white people chairman mao seton accurately stated as
recorded the collected works of mao seton it is well known that when you do anything unless you
understand its actual circumstances its nature and its relation to other things you will not know the laws
governing it or know how to do it or be able to do it well with this in mind all black people
everywhere must begin to understand the exact and specific nature of the war that is being waged against the black collective
all black people must begin to understand in depth why we are witnessing black males being shot dead
almost daily by white males in uniforms why it will soon escalate to more than one per day
without a specific understanding of why we are seeing this behavior we are unable to organize behaviors to
meet this war strategy effectively furthermore black people everywhere must begin to understand why
the black collective and black males in particular have been under intense attack
for the past two thousand years indeed jesus was a black male who was lynched
by uniform white male roman soldiers two thousand years ago as a result of the same war that has
continued into the present day extension of the same roman white empire
whenever there is a sense of increased vulnerability within the local land or global white collective as for
example caused by inflation currency devaluation unemployment loss of war
counter struggle by non-white peoples arabs controlling and limiting oil supplies iranians taking white hostages
black guerrillas struggling in southern africa and the loss of the vietnam war there will be an increase of the
ever-present normal daily slaughter and murder of black and other non-white males by those
both legally and illegally authorized to do so this murdering slaughter will be
logically viewed as justified within a specific logic framework of the fear of white genetic
annihilation within the historic framework of western civilization and culture the civilization and culture are
organized to prevent white genetic annihilation all white peoples have the spoken or unspoken mandate
to participate actively in her collective struggle for global white genetic survival
this specifically means of necessity the murder and slaughter of black and other non-white males whenever it is felt
within the white collective to be necessary and therefore justified because black males of all non-white
males have the greatest potential to genetically annihilate the white collective black males will experience the greatest
ferocity of white supremacy's attacks through justifiable homicide because
black and other non-white males have the potential to produce white genetic annihilation through their use of genitalia
and because genetic annihilation is the most fundamental fear of the global white collective this
collective consciously or unconsciously evolved a counter weapon or system of
weapons that theoretically could achieve non-white genetic annihilation the sport of hunting animals in most
instances they have black or dark brown fur in the white supremacy system culture wherein this is
thrill excitement and pleasure associated with the killing is the way in which the white collective
most specifically the white male collective stays in physical and psychological readiness for killing black and other non-white
males justifiable homicide albeit that this obsessive practice may be functioning at
unconscious levels of brain computer activity unlike black and other non-white peoples who killed animals for food and shelter
purposes the white collective engages in this activity as obsessive sport and play
by using a gun the great equalizer against helpless animals they attempt to achieve a sense of manhood
and security a fleeting sense of manhood can be achieved by the white male sports hunter because in killing a large black or
brown animal the symbolic non-white male there has been a symbolic destruction of the major threat to white genetic
survival since the achievement however is only symbolic it must be repeated and so as
soon as the hunting season opens it is time to hunt again it's the same in the same period in
which there has been an increasing incidence of justifiable homicide there's also been an increasing enthusiasm for killing helpless animals
making such hunting locations as potter's county pennsylvania world famous white adult males have been
taught by their fathers to kill and destroy helpless animals for sport and in turn the next generation of white males is taught
the means by which to ensure white genetic survival non-white males may say that they also
hunt and enjoy hunting but obviously hunting does not carry the same unconscious meaning for the non-white male as it does for the white
male in the context of global white supremacy furthermore black males have never have gotten a thrill from hunting
down white males with dogs and rifles as has so frequently been practiced by white males
against black males it is absolutely critical that all black people examine and think through the meaning of the following acts facts
at the same very same time black males are being shot down in the street in ever-increasing numbers august 31st
1980 washington post reported that poland a so-called communist country already is asking the
united states to increase credits for grain purchases from 550 million in the current fiscal year to
670 million in the fiscal year that begins october 1st in order to finance the feed grain
it needs to build up meat production do enemies provide finance or feed grain to build up meat
production for one another on august 12th the press reported a west german loan of 672 million dollars
designed to help bail poland out of the economic difficulties on august 22nd a consortium led by the
bank of america granted poland an additional 325 million dollars a recent unclassified cia study reveals
that the west has lent poland a total of 21 billion dollars to bulk of its the bulk of it in the last five
years the same study reports that the west has lent the soviet bloc as a whole an astronomical 78 billion
dollars an amount equal to the total assets of exxon and general motors combined
other experts put the total debt figure well above 100 billion why are we bailing poland and a soviet
union out of their economic difficulties feeding them massive transfusions of hard currency to buy bread for the rest of masses
and technology to booster of obsolete centralized economies why are
western banks relieving the usrsr of the expensive burden of propping up the polish economy
and regime the answer lies in a terse banker's paradox make a small loan and you have created a
debtor make a large loan and you have created a partner the one billion dollars which western banks have
funneled to poland during the current crisis is a startling political intervention on behalf of that
country's communist regime the critical question for black people is who is the real enemy
while massive numbers of black males are unemployed and increasing numbers are being shot down in streets in a presumably capitalist
country the same capitalist country is helping white communist countries and their workers return to their jobs
and have sufficient meats and other foods on their table basically the u.s is supporting the whole white so-called
communist bloc this does not include the chinese-speaking non-white people what is starkly
illustrated here is that capitalism and communism are not two enemies but simply the two
extreme ends of a total spectrum of economic practices under the system of white supremacy
wherein it is all of priority that all whites males in particular have jobs whether they are at the right or left
economic ends of the white supremacy spectrum the same would be true of the democratic party republican
party political spectrum which in this area of the world is a total political spectrum of politics
under white supremacy also it must not must be noted that while black males are being shot down in
increasing numbers and experiencing high employ unemployment white cuban communists and mass numbers are being admitted to find their places
jobs and housing in this capitalist country and are referred to as political refugees black haitians
however are not admitted and treated similarly in the black in the global white supremacy system all
persons classified as non-white are outside the white power spectrum and are in effect the real enemy
thus they are manipulated and or eliminated at the will of that power system
in the context of global white supremacy the only permanent enemies are those persons capable of white genetic annihilation
meaning black and all other non-white people most specifically male in the most
narrow perspective justifiable homicide refers to the overt shooting murders of black male or black males by
white un uniformed males in a broader perspective justifiable homicide also
can refer to the numerous more subtle tactics of black male control and destruction to deny black males jobs
and genuine upward mobility is to deny them the functional roles of husband and father to deny black family units
functional husbands and fathers on a massive level is to deny these families stability and to deny male children
models for adult malfunctioning deprivation of male models for male functioning means permanent black male
social dysfunctioning affecting all areas of people activity for multiple generations
the massive increase of black male bisexuality and homosexuality to epidemic proportions can be correlated
directly to the base functioning of adult black males and black family units by the racist system
the large number of black males engaging in drug use and abuse including alcohol also is tied directly
to severely crippling black family structure brought about through systematically denying black males functioning roles as
husbands and fathers the massive numbers of black males trapped in a juvenile system
and a penal system also are related directly to the absence of truly functional fathers and families
and husbands in the home from which these victimized males have come current statistics
1980 indicated among blacks the proportion of one parent families is a staggering 49 percent 1.8 million
families this is 83 percent higher than a decade ago poverty rates among one parent units are
enormously high and higher than among two parent units the television media also plays a major
role in reinforcing the basement of the black male bill cosby is debased by always being
depicted conversing at the level of infants muhammad ali is debased
by always being shown clowning chasing roaches and biting into sandwiches instead of watermelons
sherman hemsley character mr jefferson as the jeff in the jeffersons is always clowning acting like a monkey and
climbing over furniture in spite of supposed superior economic attainment
mr jefferson is contrasted to a more intelligent manly white male who is married to a
black female who in real life is married to a white male with the massive failure and absence of
black adult male models and family constellations in real life television provides black male use with
the white father model of the white shadow the conditioning these children to get used to the absence of black male models
and to look up to the white adult male as the man the steam is advanced further in fantasy island starring
her vela chase and different strokes starring gary coleman most black people will look particularly
at gary coleman and say he's a millionaire however both gary coleman and herv are non-white males with constitutional
and or genetic deficiencies causing their physical stature to be abnormally short
yes they are indeed excellent actors but is their genetic or constitutional abnormality playing
opposite adult white males of normal physical height that is the core white supremacy presentation in
both of these popular television series the profoundly destructive statement that black and other non-white males are
genetically and constitutionally defective compared to white males is the subtle core message that is being
propagated over the airways this image of non-white male genetic of non-white male genetic
and constitutional abnormality is set forth weekly while as background newspapers and radios give
continuous coverage on a discussion of nobel prize winner dr william shockley about the supposed
genetic inferiority of black people and a need for their sterilization several years ago the weekly television
presentation and promotion of the black male as a female and a transvestite as portrayed
in flip wilson's role of geraldine was a simile undermining of the black male's genetic makeup and masculinity
there was is is no such similar weekly television portrayal of a well-dressed white male
as a female and a transvestite in white supremacy system and culture blacks and other non-white
people do not perceive these messages because they are blind to the context of white supremacy power structure
that surrounds them they look at such programs and are pleased they smile laugh nonetheless this
continued presentation of black genetic inferiority makes the final destruction of blacks appear
to blacks themselves as a relief from the burden of their own genetic inadequacy one can be assured that there
will never be a weekly television presentation of a constitutionally and genetically deformed blue-eyed blonde white male
playing opposite and intelligently behaving black male of normal stature as long as the white
supremacy system remains intact these more subtle means of achieving justifiable homicide or
serve all serve to advance the ultimate goal of white genetic survival for with black adult males unable to
function as men on drugs and prisons as clowns and buffoons as infants and perceived genital genetic defectives transvestites
and homosexuals there will not be a major threat of white genetic annihilation and white genetic survival is assured
the white collective cannot be asked to cease their drive for justifiable homicide in its gross and subtle forms
to do so would mean white suicide it is therefore the self-respecting task of blacks and other non-whites
to understand the war and the behavior dynamic of white supremacy in which they are presently trapped
though this understanding we must evolve our own behavior in all areas of people activity that will eventually checkmate this
global white white necessity and injustice black people may begin by educating all black
male children to understand white supremacy by putting increased pressure on black males to recognize their role
as husbands and fathers this understanding means that black men must work and provide support for their families
which the white collectives attempt to prevent them from doing males who do not demand and fight
if necessary to have jobs cannot become husbands or fathers most certainly teenage male children
cannot become parents which means that black females will have to learn when and under under that circumstance they should
relate to black males in the act of sexual intercourse and self-reproduction this internal
pressure to preserve the role of black manhood becomes a means by which the concept of black manhood is developed and preserved by black
people themselves this activity will counter the thrust of the black male as female clown infant buffoon transvestite
homosexual black males who are unwilling to fight for their manhood are thereby indicating that they debase black
manhood and will not be able to teach it to the next generation these males do not deserve the privilege
of procreating themselves and this should be enforced by all black females who are self-respecting
white supremacy is war against black people and generally against black males in particular as
embodied in such tactics and strategies as in as in justifiable homicide it would
require total commitment and counter war effort on the part of all black people to neutralize by
every means at their disposal this war of racists and justice as black people we also can adopt a
definition under the conditions of white supremacy black manhood does not mean macho or
money but instead it means warrior or soldier against white supremacy embracing everything that the words
warrior or soldier imply those who do not wish to be warriors the soldiers should not procreate themselves
as their offspring can be expected to be destroyed by white supremacy anyway this is by no means a definite statement
on black response to justifiable homicide but it is an attempt to elevate the discussion on this
specific white supremacy war strategy further discussion amongst black people will help to define all necessary
behavioral response
