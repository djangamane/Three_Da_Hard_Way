haters didn't want to do it but they say this could be dangerous to let these
Negroes congregate for any reason simple
negative goggies go on and sing and stuff it'll keep them happier when they're working in the plane you know
for a week you know they can't work unless they sing they fall out about halfway through the day of doing I know
singing with them if they sing they can make it from sunup to sundown you can't see the money can't see attack but
they'll only make it to noon if we don't everything so let them do some sang so that's what what that's all we needed
right we got together and start singing the songs we would sing songs like my
lord what a morning oh yeah when the stars begin to fall like man this is it a doggy show sound
good they got perfect harmony and they singing about the stars in the sky we didn't they're talking about the
people that's in control but a mortar but we'd strike then yeah we were
talking about then they would sing steal away steal away to Jesus say oh we got a man they really end of Jesus with none
of the main ships to bring us over here was the good ship Jesus so Jesus
represented a way back home it represented a ship so they figure we
singing about the idea do we sing about a ship to take us home but because we
sang it in a language that they could accept we do what we've seen this our
black church started off and I got away from that so my solid state but most of got away that's how it started off their
confrontation and come by here my lord come down here you know that was Harriet another Harriet Tubman's peace when they
sang that's how she knew where to stop off what station in railroad and the grammar errors that I pick off you keep
on commenting on an altar - what - come sit and be freedom back there but it was a lot better than it was measure of
freedom that we here so let those kind of saw then the plantation preacher
the greatest preachers we have ever had me here I don't care who we him we have not heard of preaching in our lifetime
like the preacher that James Weldon Johnson tried to capture in his book guards trombone like the preaching of
them preachers on that plantation I mean I don't think there's anybody and we've had some fine preachers in our day that
could match them and they could go from plantation to plantation and in the
sermon it gave instructions to where to meet and gather for the slave revolt and
for slave escape see there was a lot more slave revolts than what we know about the Sun and they would not tell
let you know that they wouldn't let it go from plantation to plantation because I didn't want word to get around that the nighttime revolt was so dynamic you
couldn't escape it they gave me a price on the nemah this it was so dynamic you couldn't get around that's a that became
public now but there were far more advanced than they talked about I am a
descendant Oh John Campbell was my
great-great-grandfather who had a slave revolt in West Petersburg Virginia that's how I got to be like I am today
inherit that so but that's a revolt that most people don't know it didn't my family knew about it and they tell the
story to every generation and I remember being a little boy said now he and his story of John Campbell that they told
behind closed doors and every time we had a family gathering they would sit
around and talk about this and I found as I talked to many people as our travel country there was a lot more slavery
boats oh yeah then we know all that and it was because of them preachers preaching on the plantations and them
songs they were singing also they used to pray in a way when they would pray
out loud so you weren't allowed to go from this plantation to the other plantation unless you had a pass from
master alright you have to you have to you have to be what will give one song
in any help you had to be you have a stake and find where he told you you had
can find you couldn't get on another plant didn't change ideas with your brothers and sisters you couldn't do
that so what we would do if we'd go out in the woods and pray and while we will
pray in our don't Gabriel Prosser
rebellion get the process rebellions and to Parker woods if it's not so did my
best Rafael you know sorry the best thing he does in South Carolina when
they heard out found out when some House Negroes told him what was happening with our whole communication system was they
stopped them from having the preacher go around by himself he had to have a white
man that's right always present right and the white man read the text and not
the preacher couldn't use it and that's why you seen a lot of church today they still do that somebody who read the text
and the preacher would hope what they said that came in effect a white man had to read the text and say and it was text
like slaves obey your master and all that kind of stuff so that was cut off
and they found out about the singing they stopped they put a ban on the song
they put a ban on the praying out loud only one thing they would have had to kill too much of what they considered to
be their property because there was no way you could stop a black person from praying in the first place and secondly
you couldn't stop them from praying out loud they had to pray out loud mm-hmm and so what they did they say
they passed a law say it since we can't stop them from praying out loud they got to put a bucket over their head when they pray right and that's why when you
see these sketches and itches of the black church on the plantation you'll see a bucket sitting there bat off
there's a bucket because you cannot stop us from shouting us and we feel the goodness of the Lord and I have says
there's nothing we won't share you cannot stop that attract me and so they had to put that bucket okay
so when he couldn't you had a preacher they couldn't sing the songs and they couldn't pray and that's where that song
came from we down young by myself
see that that's what that song meant I couldn't hear nobody pray because they were used to hit each other pray and
getting the message back that's a precious heart way down to by myself how could it mean nobody right then
somebody said well what are we gonna do we can't and preacher can't carry the message we can't sing the song we can't
pray out loud and feels in the moment what we're going to say they out in the
field picking the car picking the cotton and they're trying to figure out what to doing something for superior the Lord
fell on somebody and they said somebody
else picked it up they made a cold after the poem and passed it from plantation
to plantation that's why with art blakey did that piece more than threads and ammon and dancing I don't see on me a
sacrilege to church that's a little piece that moaning that's what at home
no way so I just want to give you look back there on one sing one song and then
we're going to turn it over to dr. Jack fella when we start out with the song they used to sing in the words on the
plantation woke up this morning with my mind stayed on Jesus but we're going to
sing it in the words we knew their bidding men I'm gonna sit and we're gonna say woke up this morning with my
mind stayed on liberation alright woke up this morning with mine
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause] [Music]
[Music]
[Music] to our ancestors honor and praise particularly to our
elders those in our family and I want to
give praise and mention to all those who paid the supreme price for our freedoms
as a people as Jesus's said greater love
there's no man that he lay down his life with a friend and that's the supreme sacrifice even
people that you may not agree with on one point or another they stand up and
get it likely I think there's no argument if their commitment was in
question at any point once they give up the supreme sacrifice there's no question to level there I said there are
those who not an agreement I wasn't in the bring up with dr. King's nonviolent
method however I love dr. King and I never questioned his love for us and
there's no commitment and if I had questioned about his global commitment
especially I find how I knew he could have ordered his death and he chosen his
life over his purpose Malcolm who I had follow an agreement with in fact I don't
know anything i disagree with Malcolm about except his experience in Mecca and
he didn't have chance to soak that through before they took him away from and I certainly if I had any doubts
about his commitment I had none after that because he was offered asylum in
other countries he could have gotten out of here and saved his life but he chose
to stay here and put it on the line for us so now what are you confused about what Malcolm said or did or whatever you
cannot deny and you should always uphold him before your children as a hero
because the man willfully gave up his life trying to complete a work so I
can't mention all those folks like a sort of sister Fannie Lou Hamer although she did she would be to within an inch
of her life and went the rest of her life with pain and scars that followed it to the grave
because her commitment was to us first rather than to herself but that is
something one of them to be proud of it appraisal to celebrate and so in the
name of her brother Bob and dr. King and all of them in the Panthers who had died
and fighting for us all those people I would say them words of the last poets
to sum it up blessed are those who struggle oppression is worse than the
grave it is better to live in that for noble common to live and die and as
always whenever I speak it is only by their auspices that we have the power to
speak because if they had not stood up we would not be able to stand them if
they had not paid the way we would not be interesting I want to give
- Reverend Mother lot is it all right
who is my mother - alright I have listened jack is my brother in the
spirit and this is my mother and I want to give thanks to her for opening the
doors of the church and inviting us in and letting us come in and fellowship and worship and share with you here
today I've seen the time's running out and I see you getting tired so I won't leave much longer I want to say this to you
this is my last presentation on this trip here we've been here for five days
we've been making presentations promoting the books and tapes and I've
had to mention more often than I care to mention because I'm kind of
uncomfortable at fundraising and stuff that's just not me however it's necessary and I know if we don't sell
out which it was up to me I need to give them away that's what my family don't let me handle business because I used to
give stuff away and they would end up suffering so they don't let that mom and
you handle it even so but I lead one of
the things we've been trying to do I'm trying to raise money so I can continue to finish the book I'm working on now
the awesome power of the African centered mind which has something in for
everybody black people really into the Bible and I'm finally really off you can find out all the scriptures in there
dealing a lot of folks think equate being a Christian or being or follow of
any particular faith with poverty that you're serving God is knowledge mental
poverty now the only people on earth I know who do that are our people or oppress people white people don't take
that way they they can have all the wealth of the earth and still be good Christians or whatever they profess to
be with you whatever they profess to be we're not only people to think we in order to serve our God we have to be
full and then they'll stand up and profess that we're serving a god that could meet our every need and owns
everything in the world now what father did you know and Jesus said that so beautifully if his son come
to him he's hungry he gave a stalinist el hombre so the Creator is how father
we've got regular sentence of the Creator I'm dealing with that a little bit as I go on how and why the world do
you think then we're not supposed to get the fruit of the land and wealth of this land and I hope they have somebody
especially attending the David so hard in some of the folks involved in the Black Liberation Movement think that we
are supposed to remain impoverished or else we'll become corrupt if we get prospered try Pharisees and not supposed
to corrupt you if you're spiritually a tomb and we're not supposed to be struggling along here with it with the
thoughts and ideas we have I'm gonna be honest with you and I'm not being arrogant the thoughts and ideas that
African thinkers have could liberate that we need this race with the whole entire world it could never make the
whole world now the only reason why the whole world hasn't heard about it and
isn't aware of it is because we do not have the resources to be them Lord knows we try we go everywhere anywhere street
corner church anywhere we can go just share the mass so the only way it can be
carried on is through the support of people and we serve and so it is to the
purchasing about books and tapes and I have to keep doing these black nationalist commercials wherever I go
fourth dynasty publishing company our family business there publishes my works
and they're planning to publish other people's works we're trying to work up to that wish we were in a position to
publish dr. and uh that's what we're trying to get to that point dear so they shouldn't have to be worried
about our eldest college who have been doing this for so long after they finish your work now how they gonna raise the
money to get it out and they do and if somebody's folk out there they're supposed to be in the house
instead of book business fact you are the very few of them and now I'm not mentioning names only one name on don't
mention that that's the man I trusted most in the business who has proven to be most honorable and that's deacon David Rives and dmj both but some of
them take advantage of the scholars and get more money out of product and they
know they should be Guinea and even the scholar looks Explorer don't uncover leader scholar with less term nation
beginning was the scholar who came up with the idea in the concept I know
because we haven't been covered from being beat out of some money people to get on but we still struggling around at pawn anything in the house you keep
things going holding when I got up here we'd be able to sell enough Wilson takes keep things going and that should not be
I'm not complaining or crying I'm just saying these things have to be corrected
and we must demand when we hear about these injustice we must address them and
keep it in the race because more more white folk settle our problems for us these seventeen said the chain things
dark of reality Christopher Columbus's did not discover America it was chock full of documentation everyone used to
have this and that your children listen to this and when you children listen to this take my daughter to the school and
the teacher tried to take it out she said whether it's too heavy is too deep it's to it but she said no my daddy said
and all my children can pick up on this all children if they listen to it so she had a Clayton take my daughter won't go
there get away with yeah it is well
documented the book it's the excerpts with the book I was working on of the same title but I have to put the book
aside because when I look at the book and how big it's becoming it's going to cost us so much money to produce it
I won't get in the same hole I got in with this book it cost me over twenty thousand dollars of the two says I
haven't got out of that home yet so I realize I'm gonna have to do that Jack Felder here yeah
taught me what to do I can't I can't write as concisely as he can't he's a journalist my books would be a little
larger than his but I've got to produce things under $10 pretty particularly considering the economy but even though
we produced this one I thought it was going to be 150 pages I kept on writing Minister Brown I couldn't stop writing
us in solid with every stop I think I care if I went out in the woods and screaming how to please let me go on
this one and I couldn't stop right now you put all in there yeah I wish you
could see my foul but I had to stop in somewhere I had to borrow money from every which way direction couldn't pay
people back and called me a ripoff artist but all that time I'll pay it again I had to go through are able to do this
is the best book I've ever written but it's not selling at the best book I've
ever read and I said must because they not a way of it of yeah and I realized that when we first published it in released it in
July 15 last year we went south and when were in the Midwest and that's where we
did the promotion point now book on a holiday there by nobody I felt responsible for that the one of our
department of black man's destiny is moving they can't keep Minister but this
one is just kind of sitting there and it shouldn't be it is to bet what you have
heard many talk about I have went to our we have shown directly how the story
that we'll be talking on a minute Oh genesis in the bible of the origin of humanity you've heard people say that it
came from african intent and some have in their writings our scholars have
shown some of it I went directly it showed how from how the Bible story was
taken from all these other different stories that Africans had established all over the globe India Persia Arabia
and there's a lot in this book I believe that in reading and I had people tell me
that that it will help to enhance the quality of because these ancient concepts even
though they're kind of difficult is so far removed from them and they're very ancient if you keep working with them
there's something inside of you that makes contact with them and it brings
about a change in your holes of life and that's what we need a change of scope
the reason why we are confined to these ghettos and slums is because we have the main to think on that demo
once we expand our scope when our scope was large we weren't on a level we could
build those gargantuan statuary pyramids and not only in Africa anyway you're going to where are you gonna see these
great things built by black people I mean huge huge they will cut out sides
of mountains then we cut out stuff there was a tee time ago snatches out of one
piece Dave Hall 80 tons 500 miles and so with 600 miles somewhere else why could
they do that the cabouchins were little people by statue human statue however everything
they built was huge right Wow they may
have been smaller than physical statue but this hope of thinking was fast the
scope of thinking was godlike because the creative things on a vast cosmic plane and it is not serving the Creator
to confine our thoughts to just these conditions we live on and we'll never be able to change these conditions and to
learn to think beyond that and that's one of these things one of the things that focus the design to help me do let
me get on now y'all right can you give me a few more humanity get up and go on
that plantation tomorrow and everything and got to travel to the streets and all that and get there and get you a little
rest in and gets a little time there relax and everything for you have to go meet them again I don't use that term a
man but if he's a man what did we not
the child control everything all right
brothers and sisters I'm going to go into scriptures here a minute in Ezekiel the first chapter 26 through 28 verses
read a scripture that is not commonly known to most people not only is it not
commonly known it's not generally understood what it means it was designed
to be and that is because of the English in translating from the ancient tongues
first and Greeks were the first to translate from ancient African tongues in the in Bhutan and all that Hebrew has
been another one of the family of African languages did not have enough words in their language to have complete
translations because he was a younger language trying to translate from a much older life so there's a lot of confusion
in their translation however if you know your history if you have keys to unlock
the mystery you can go in and put his back in the proper language wiebe and above the firmament that was
over their head was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire
stone get this pitch in I want you to keep these symbols in mine and upon the
lightness of the throne was the lightness as the appearance of a
man above honey and as I saw as the color of animal as the appearance of
fire round about it from the appearance of his loins even upward and so the appearance of his Loren
even down I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness
and the appearance of the boat that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was
the appearance of the brightness frowned without this was the appearance of the
lightness of the glory of the law and when I saw it I fell upon my face and I
heard a voice now we need to deal with this we're gonna do an African Synod
exegesis in the seminary we'd like to do exegesis african-centered exegesis on
the test today now mother Evelyn Felder you know all that prophecy when the
prophets right they used symbolic language the reason why they had used
survive and many times is because when they were writing a condition whereby they were being oppressed by another in
a foreign land they couldn't tell the story to claim or it could get them hurt
in the hog you can kill and they can never get their message to people just like talking about earlier we were
singing those songs that were cold songs on a plantation and they had to sing them in that language when they wanted
to say freedom they had to say Jesus in order to keep the master from messing
with but we know what they meant and they know what they meant and how do we know by the results of what those songs cost
because as a result she knows a lot people got off the plantation because
they would use this code language for the folk who come and deliberate on the stop band game same thing was happening
here you see she was in Babylon use an impression of the Babylonians one group
of black people were present another group of about a time that they came to a secured it would predominantly
Eurasians there because they have taken the land from the original black people they talk about that and
it's planet and show the transition which took place in this book African Genesis the original Babylonians were
very black people Kiki had people and they will call Akkadian Babylonians the
Babylonians who invaded the Semitic type the Eurasian looking when the mixed-up
ones the wannabes who came they will
call the Kassite Babylonia they invaded
about 1200 before the Common Era I better stop and explain what I mean
before the Common Era not everybody in the world is a Christian now that the
value of the world has to be a Christian to know God not everybody has to be dead
they all find Muslim people who are posted to the Creator then many
Christian people they are Buddhists who are much closer than Baba who meditate
get in tune every day so we can't be arrogant and think what our system of belief is it is the only way to create a
judgement then that means you got control over God if you got the only way
to it you gonna tell him you can only got one way that people can come to you and yet creator has put people all over
the planet with different cultural experiences and our religion comes out of cultural experience yeah that's what
it does all people behold and conceivable Knigge in terms of the cultural experience only
we conceive of it in terms of somebody else's cultural experience right minutes
later we can see from a euro sense it culturally space we can
some white daughter some white Jesus somewhere that's bad cultural experience it's not our culture and being sinful
for us to view the creator of sin creator in our own cultural experience
man in our own image that the truth here of the Baptist one time I think was jobs
and there Johnson wasn't named one of the King couldn't get along it was always fighting came all the time he
stood up an impotent before at the Baptist conference with thousands and
thousands of black people in front of us it was a person is ascending from God
him to be in a natural state that God often via him then you are accusing the creator of doing wrong I made a mistake
by making people black all right now I
think that human code that I would stand I have to talked about with one group of Africans who were being controlled by
Eurasians who were oppressing another group which with the Hebrews which are the discussions in a minute of 90 to
read my books dr. Balian stated it all got caught all of it it should be clear to anybody by now that has heard
anything that these people were not called ingested and is better looking
people there were people that look like us yes I'm going to deal with that any
minute alright now the title of our message today is you shall know the
truth and the truth will set you free you know people say it a lot
I saw me doesn't it let's see first let me clear something
another man I'm not trying to get a following I'm
not trying to steal anybody's Thunder I'm not coming to beat up on any other
black people I only got energy to belittle my natural enemy yeah all of you that you don't happen it's my
natural I have since I'm no financial and look out for I'm glad I waited for
two men but I don't protect myself you get out so I'm not here to attack anyone
system of belief I'm simply asking that
we get to the point where we do not allow a ceiling to be placed on our
mental development consciousness and use our belief in and blame it on God as an
excuse for doing now that has to stop brother Malcolm sitting your religion
doesn't motivate you to change your condition for what did he integrated obviously you mean degree thank you
blending God say the dog want me in this condition you know good well the Creator
doesn't want you in this condition we're truth and I've got to stop and
define this word truth because folks think that what they know they are religious belief in it concept of veto
that's all the truth day word truth as
used in the New Testament from the text I believe is in the book of John and their mother I but give some time
exactly where it is that got over something I'm told that text for over 30 years what Jesus is reported to have
said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free it comes from that I remember translating it when I
was in the seminary from the coin Greek or the common Greek language that the
New Testament Gospels were translated into written written in the coin Greek
at that time of Greek was the language of scholarship in those days and I remember translating the word
from our Lydia which means according to the facts it
had nothing to do with the system underneath it means according to the fact can you prove it that's what you
feel - is based on something concrete that you can substantiate with something
tangible or some natural law it had none of you would believe belief is
altogether something different we're gonna use your name our belief you shouldn't debate believe you should disturb me believe this person you
cannot prove or disprove a person's belief I don't mess with that said I don't know what a person need to believe
you keep them going however I do have to make us aware of
the historical realities you can keep your belief and still deal
with historical reality always make them out of a shinobi a frightened when we come to you with these facts and said
you're trying to take away the damn Dale shield knows of it and he doesn't mean that because he's buried he reads
everything bad all those he left they get them to shot my book he's very good
problem very wise man where you're always kidding us about a family trying to take his Jesus and we always tell
them I said Jay I would not try to take him Jesus we try to make it real funny that's what
we try to do so that's the thing let's let me finish talking about this
truthful minute and then I'll get into the text there should never be as I just
mentioned a ceiling on the truth that can't be a ceiling on the truth because the truth is ever unfolding yes truth is
ever revealed yeah now you got to only choose you don't stop - you don't turn off the
faucet you don't get no more you don't got all the water you need you
don't got all the water today is for you when you turn it off just write what you
understanding what you believe in ain't no mom you didn't cut the faucet off you have to need a faucet on for the
gorgotron and that's how truth is truth continues to flow so I can't really ever
reveal it truth become brighter a light that comes right and right and right after Union fight you bought an American
figure that's all the truth but as you grow up you learn some other truth you
don't very popcorn really green I
remember when I was coming up as a board we didn't promise we had to live him when I was very young we didn't have
backup therefore we every said him my mother used to have taken put us in
front of him some of y'all may not know what I'm talking about and take us in front of you know top 10 jobs I was when
we booked in the first apartment that we had how many memories you know when I
got to where they have a shower so what I'm saying - you've noted that some
sordid truth yeah the truth was the baby you gotta wash yourself to be healthy
yes planning is even part of diamonds however my hind septum that truth would
limit it to a tent town but they're gonna concept the dead tooth grew
expanded when I got to a bathtub and then when I got to a shower after all showed up
so my brothers the sisters never put a seal if I don't know what that idea
across many Orthodox religions try to
put a ceiling on truth yes I mean they prohibit you to think
beyond the perimeters of their particular system of belief many
religion does that to you it is not serving you it is programming you to serve a that's
the church's pull to certain people am i right now you correct me from now not
that people serve it all right y'all still and the truth shall set you free
it's a few an African centered view of the Bible and religion we're going to be
talking about now let me get into this text we know at the very beginning of
the scriptures this particular scripture in the book of Genesis it starts out by
saying in the beginning God first of all I mentioned this before but I gotta
mention it again y'all go me have to go in there the
other nerves and that y'all had continued just brie with me but you gotta learn I'm saying is that I've been
physically ejected from
the word God should not be used in reference to the divine intelligence the
creator in the universe why because it is the word dog spelled backwards right
and it was put in the King James Version of the Bible the King James Version was
not translated into the year 1611 it cannot therefore be the unadulterated Word of God even the book itself tell
you that God spoke to Moses spoke to the Ezekiel in spoken prophets in a long
time before 16 and ever so this cannot
be don't wanna do any work it's a translation of the ancient scriptures so
don't get upset see you trying to take my Bible from your discipline is not yours but since it's the one we all have
I'm trying to give it back to you I'm trying to make it yours you already met with in the beginning
the ancients had the right terminology the ancient africans in chemic they
refer to the creative force the divine intelligence in the universe at the one okay the one is everywhere in every
blade of grass and every leaf on a retreat and every drop of rain one
everywhere in every particle of atom in the air to breathe the one is there for
all things in nature have been intelligence in our part of a central
Universal divine intelligence they are for because of their concept and
understanding of the creative force better than any people have ever had
since that time they would not build a house to what they call the one because
they say you couldn't contain the one in a house that's why we now keep going to
the rest of it I did a message the other day their brother taking stuff on here as to why some more detail on this word
gods fill up that wasn't I'm just going to have time to do this text it looks like let me do this test is it matter
beginning what's the creative we're gonna put it that way the one we're gonna put them
we're gonna translate the text into it after certain things we got to a retranslation here all right in the beginning what's the
one now in the Bible it describes what
the one looked like Lynn the prophets
beheld a vision now be very careful here
because you almost say gone ain't got no cup God is a spirit that is truly divine
intelligence in the universe the Creator is a spiritual force however when it
reveals itself to human beings in a way that they can comprehend are you with me
now okay it was always as a female first and then
as a male that's what shocked some of you alright first revealed as the mother force then is the father I'll have time
to get into that now you can pop open you read and I we documented the oldest concept of
religion on earth was the religion which respected the mother force as the original force and that's why Africans
today pray mother father God because you can't have no father ready just came not even on that level
everything has to have exchange between masculine citizen injury but that's another story given to reality woman the
original guardian angel and seafood sometimes but I wouldn't kind of screen at this book they are afraid to come
face to face with who live there they are you to define when you mother of the universe and you have been beat down so
long it mean to think that you know buddy is sitting on the planet and that you got a look as much like white women
to be look like somebody you know I'm going to beat down so much is hard for you to confront the fact did you work
the beauty queen on earth moment without
all the statues created by human beings go back between thirty and forty
thousand years ago and they are all the first image that anybody tractor why
because in those days she was ravine
African woman there's no body name you deal with it okay y'all still with yeah I'm trying to get to it now John I get
to it let me get in into the text she isn't above the firmament that was
over the head was the likeness of the throne as the appearance of what sapphire stone now if you're talking
somebody to talk prophetic language here in prophetic language they use symbols
to illustrate principles what is the Sapphire from the sapphire
throne represents heaven in this book have it in this book and I have it in
this book see I was going to go into the books with you tonight the time the permit you'll have to get the books I
can do it document it that's what I'm trying to take I'm gonna tell you I'm not getting back based on over 30 years of research so I
didn't just come out there which is I'm coming back and telling people something that they are amazing you know no it's
amazing it may sound kind of been around for many many years it ain't nothing new about it at our the sapphire throne
represents the lap of the Divine Mother
because all the tones in the ancient world represented the lap of the mother
the oldest Thrones we know anything about less than half were first built
with on the African continent we know the first kings they ever work in the
world were first on an African continent because they were the first people to
have kingdoms and civilizations to rule over because the longest lived in the
oldest people on earth are black people you cannot get around that there's no
way that you can get around and all the facts are pointing to that reality that the original people came out of Africa
that the Godman even was originally in Africa by the Nile River and if you read the book of Genesis carefully he will
tell you that the river Jihan is the Nile River but you got to know the Hebrew to know that that's what
we're here for they have translated back way all right now the oldest throne was
in Africa by the Nile River in the ancient kingdoms and empires what was
called push the word push means people of the Sun of Sunkist people not to
argue we decide when the Greeks came along they could not pronounce the K
sound so they came up with a word men
burnt face to them but their name of the people will cush I'd people kiss to the
Sun out of there came a people call Kemet ins the people of the soil from
which we get the word today what chemistry the word itself is a
description of the people land people from the black soil from the land of the plants is what Kenneth needs
and what the word chemistry means because the only soil on earth that contains all of the chemical
government's that make up the human body is the black soil not the Rebs or not
the sameness or only the black soul that's all those chemicals you have dr.
fellow who's a chemist any day and I've seen it when I was in the seminary under
the microscope and we've analyzed the soils the various soil that's all now
they created the concept of the throne and the king and in their literature
they stick very clearly and I do document in an afternoon when the original guardian angel that it was the
black woman who created the system of governance who created laws to
discipline the community because the man was perfectly happy running wild in the woods chasing after mines elephant
whatever you could take that even haven't go lucky it was the woman who made any domestic it was a woman who planted the crops so
that he stopped running and chasing food and can sit down and eat some food he could take time to do something else by
chase food before this time it's a woman who said that situation therefore she
put him on the throne because she says I really don't have time to deal with anything as mundane as running a
government or nation I got to take care of the arts and sciences and civilization since the creator gave you
the natural wrong and the power to defend us against any enemy or any
threat I'll put you on the throne but you sit there I'm not power because the
throne is the lack of the mother which the Greeks call Isis in the ancient Paul
all set and you will see pictures of it I got pictures in the book when the Pharaoh
set on the throne he was saying that our set was receiving her baby child on her
on her lap the mother's lap was the throne of power because it was from the
mother's lap that we came into this world every last one that is correct that's how you came so
that's the seat of power it gives you like energy never go back
mistreat you nobody'd ever be ever given for every wave in this treating you once you know who you are and back man
no no there would never miss to tell you mister you're black women who mistreat your mama you represent your mama every
black woman on earth but I can't get into that now they'll be gone I guess it cut they're going down so that's the
throne we talk about you talk about the black woman now even in our enslavement here we identified with many ancient
concepts because they were still in our subconscious and spiritually connected with us but we didn't understand where
they came from and we began to call black women will put their hands on the
hip and shake that finger and wagging it here there no other woman can do and cut
you with that tongue like no other woman can do we call this it became a negative
connotation instead of a connotation of positive I thought she might say but
sapphire is a birth of precious time so some about it so even though we called you sapphire for acting that way
we used a term of affection to refer to you because that vice president so this
man that the dead seen as he sees in this text text is easy to the first chapter 26 before his birth he said so
on the lightness of the throne was the likeness of the parents cover my hand said no all right we got this beautiful
beautiful blue throne sapphire was a color of lapis slashing live ancient kami
alright and I saw as the color of amber this man sitting on this blue throne had
the color of family what is M a golden brown golden brown not white not yeah
not really golden brown I mean brown brown like this
back in the room that kind of boutique
you see so we meet the Texans follow me up and he said that he saw also fire
around it in the rainbow and after describing all this here's the key in
the text what was Ezekiel looking at in his vision that he's looking at in the
sky he's having a vision the prophet Ezekiel down by the river Shabbat in ancient
family his people of being oppressed by eleven people and he's called on God for
liberation in the show yourself and the first thing he sees in the first chapter
of the book that he's writing about his experience and in proxy to his people is
he gets a vision of a throne in the air sapphire drum sitting on it is the image
of a man that is golden brown in color who is this man sitting on the throne
what does this image represent knowing that prophetic language is what's
America folks in the book of Revelation can't be understood the very book itself
the title of the revelation mean reveal if you don't understand me you don't
know how to interpret assemble if you know your history you can interpret soon
one day when I come back I deal with every simple black when we get back to
hear what he CQ tells you he saw not what he shot most judges they do stop
are doing is translating the text for you in the context of the historical
experience and from the ancient Hebrew that it was a rich written in an Arabic tell me what the
words mean that he described that's all up door they're telling you what they
mean but he's now in his own language is going to tell you what he saw what it
meant to him what he saw and this is what he says in 28 verse this was the
appearance of the lightness of the glory of the bow and that's what you see see
see y'all below man he tell me we got to stop talking about black just and black
this God don't know what color Gavi got no color in here ezq saying when he saw
a vision of the glory of the lord sent me on a sapphire home he saw golden
brown land city just writing the text true the spirit doesn't have a cop
