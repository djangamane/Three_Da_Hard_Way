hotep brothers and sisters I said hotep brothers and
sisters it's good to see you welcome to the United African
movement's continuing African history month
program it's good to see you filing in I know we have some Stormy
Weather I know that for those of you who haven't been to a meeting recently this is kind of
early but we're trying to start our our meetings more and more on
time I told you we're moving we're moving from
CPT to BPT and very soon we're going to be functioning on a African people's time
how many of you were here last week how many you enjoyed the program we had with Dr Justice last
week okay good last week
our talk served as a
introduction to a continuing Series in which we're really exploring one
topic one topic and that topic is how to organize and liberate
our people our topic last week was mental
health and this week continuing in that same vein we're going to be talking
about the war to control the African mind I know a lot of you didn't think
that such a war might be going on but that's exactly what's going on if you
look in the dictionary the word War comes comes
from the Norman word the Norman French word where we r
r and what it means is an open and armed
conflict between principalities and if you look up the word
control it comes from the angl French word which means to counter by rolling
on its axis it's a means of opposing and I know that all of you know
what the African mind is when we say African mind we're talking about that
mine that originated along the Nile Valley we're talking about that mine
that erected the mud brick pyramid shaped tombs down in the lower Nile
Valley and then as we moved up the Nile Valley or down the Nile Valley Valley
depending upon your perspective but northward that began to
erect pyramids made out of Hume Stone when we say African mind we mean that
mind which has spread all over the world and whose contributions have
made those good things in the world those good things we're talking
about the mind that laid out the plans for Washington DC through Benjamin
Banica we're talking about the mind that
introduc medicine and introduced Science and Technology to the world so when we
talk about the African mind and the water control it we are talking about a
very vital subject when we talk about liberating our people because if there's a war to
control that mind and we don't even know that it's going on
then we actually are going to have to first learn that and get into that
before we can even take our next step today's
speaker Dr Amos Wilson and we have conferred a doctorate
on him we don't have to wait for anyone else to confer a doctorate on him because as I would say of Professor
Clark and I've said it before fortunately I said it before for those of you who remember I'm not saying it
because Amos is here today um if Professor
Clark and Amos Wilson aren't doctors you could take the doctorates
the phds and the MDS of most of these people out here and make toilet paper out of
them this brother's classic work the developmental psychology olog of the
black child is a book
that every person who works in the field of mental health and even lay people who
are not working in the field of mental health need to get into Amos is one of
the most intelligent people that I have ever seen he's also one of the most
intellectually honest people that I've ever seen and if you get into a conversation with him you'll find out
that he doesn't want to tell you a lie so what he'll do is is he'll ask you a
couple of questions to see if you're going to respond to him with some rhetoric or respond to him with some nonsense and if he sees that you can't
handle it he would just rather not say anything but if he sees that you can handle what it is that he has to tell
you it may not fall along the political lines that you think are correct it may
not fall along the religious lines that you think are correct but it's going to be the truth and it's going to be
something that wakes you up I remember that it was in a talk that Amos
gave about maybe four or five years ago in which he raised a question which
should have been really in every African person's mind and it was about the disease AIDS and it was a simple
thing the activities that people say caused
AIDS been going on since the the Greeks some of the earliest
Europeans so how did in the 1980s a disease spring up at the same
time all around the world in homosexuals in the United
States in heterosexuals in Haiti and in Africa and
it's a very basic kind of question and it prepared our minds for the
information that Francis wising later brought to us showing us how this bug
from the so-called green monkey had been worked on by scientists for for decades
before the epidemic spread around the world and I just use that as an example
to show you the kind of critical thinking that Amos does in all kinds of fields you can get a good talk from Amos
about medicine about psychology about history and there's
always going to be a new and intelligent twist to it and it'll always be whatever
your mind can stand brother Amos are are you ready over there you said you came here ready
right okay this is a very good brother uh brother Amos Wilson we first met him
uh I would say about N9 or 10 years ago when he came and spoke at the black
family collective series over at the county Cullen Library which eventually moved and became the Harlem Hospital
Series this is a brother who if he just concentrated on selling his book and
giving speeches could be a wealthy man but he has more in mind for us and More
in mind for himself and our people than that this brother doesn't just talk
black business and bu black he's actually uh been for years struggling
with a venture called the Harlem copy center uh on 125th Street there he's had
his ups and downs but he's hanging in there with it he does lecture it's a
it's a it's a treat when he lectures because the brother does not want to spend his time doing this doesn't want
to spend his time doing this and we're very appreciative of the Afric United African movement that he took time from
his busy schedule and from the very heavy and significant things that he's doing uh to come and pay us a visit and
to come and share some information with us I hope you'll give him a big Round of Applause by way of introduction and I
won't delay things any further I'll just say brother Dr Amos Wilson
thanks a lot thank you kindly I'm very honored
and and uh it's a pleasure indeed to be invited to share this bit of time with
you I and of course congratulate you in terms of the work you're doing and the
support you're giving our brothers here and uh very much encourage you to
continue I hope of course I wasn't the cause of our lateness I got we got caught up with
some traffic on the train and had to even go back up town and come back down again and catch a
local we're going to talk a bit today then about the war to control the
African mind in fact I remember quite some time ago when I started out on the
electric Circ I talked about war particularly
psychological warfare the idea being that we as a
people have been subjected to psychological warfare for hundreds and
hundreds of years in fact I talked
about uh how we let the Europeans structure our history for us I
was in new last week when I tried to indicate there that culture is is not
only concerned or not is not only about the behavior of a people the habits the
dress the dance the language and customs of a
people but a culture has a Time
Dimension that there is a Time Dimension relative to culture at that point I
tried to show how our children to a degree are
miseducated as a result of the fact that the time Dimension the very time schedules for classes are keyed history
is not only a way of sequencing events
it's not only a series of dates and events history involves the demarcation
of time the division of of time that our sense of history is actually a GE a
geometrical mathematical concept that history is a system of
coordinates wherein we locate ourself in time and
space we we determine past future and present in terms of our sense of history
and therefore when our history is Rewritten or when history is distorted our sense
of time and place is distorted as well and when we let them Europeans
write history and divide history up in terms of their time system they're also
then distorting our identity and distorting our sense of location and
place distorting our sense of the past as well as our
destiny so we get had a history that's divided up let us say in terms of World
War I World War II Korean War the Vietnamese War and so forth and yet as
African people when we look at War we may date the history of War quite
differently we may recognize that we have been at war with the European
continuously for the past 2,000 years and therefore we cannot accept
their demarcation of wars because that distorts our perception of ourselves and distorts our relationship
with the rest of the world beside the military war actually
psychological war is probably the most important factor involved in the
Conquering and domination of a people it is not enough just to physically conquer
a people or militarily conquer a people that requires vast experi minatures of
money men power military force police force and other kinds of
things the ultimate captivity of course involves the waging of a psychological
war against the people so that they can be controlled without without military
outlays by changing their minds and shaping their minds they will literally
become self-controlling they will literally then through their own
self-determination fit into the needs and purposes of the captive armies of
the armies that are in control of them the attempt then has been and and if we
look at the history of neoc colonialism and the history of the
European psychological warfare has been one then where the Europeans have withdrawn their governing forces where
they've withdrawn their armies and so forth but through education through cultural imperialism through the control
of information and other things have continued unabated a psychological war
against the African mind and ultimately then it must be this
war we uh have to fight and win when we talk about then the war to
control the African mind we of course should sort of Define
our terms and I I'm not going to Define m in the fullest sense of of the word because of course there are many
definitions and many perceptions of What U mind is or what it may
be I'm going to look at it though from a perspective that sees it in a dynamic
sense that sees the Mind as a sort of what we call a nodal
Point as a point of conversion and
diversion of what we may call Feld forces in other words the
mind is at the point where internal forces from the personality and from the
body and external forces from the environment impact upon one another the
mind then is a coherent system of operations that is more than a thing
because we cannot locate mind in a place we cannot look into our brain and say
this is where the mind is located when we look at the brain as it thinks we
note that the full brain usually is involved and there is constant
oscillation shifting and moving in the electrical chemical activity of the
brain there have been psychologist for instance who've tried to really locate something we might call mind or aspect
of the Mind and of course have failed at the attempt so uh under these circumstances it's
more to our advantage then to look at the mind in in an operational sense in
terms of what it does so in this sense we can say it is a
relatively coherent and active set of
operations which is which is influenced and influences the field which surrounds
it that is it is a set of operations that is influenced by the inputs from the
environment of which it is a part and a product in a way and it is affect it also acts on the
environment so it's a situation the mind then is a set of operations that seeks
to coordinate and regulate those forces those energies and
vibrations that that flow in to it from the environment from the
body and to regulate those forces and reactions that flow from the body and
from itself onto the environment itself the mind though is not only then
uh pushed back and forth by the forces that come into it from the environment
or that pushed it from the inside of the personality are from the body it is also
self-controlling and self-regulating one of the things and one of the Supreme characteristics of
the human mind is that it is self-aware we are aware of our own
thinking that is we can think and at the same time be aware that we are
thinking the human mind is self-reflecting that is it it not only
performs an operation solves problems it not only regulates those forces inside
of itself and inside of the body and help and seeks to regulate those forces coming into itself and into the
body it uses its own activities as a means of
self-regulation which means then that the mind can transcend itself it can
utilize the forces and the information coming from its own memory stores and
from its own knowledge bases it can use the information coming from the
environment coordinate that information and create a synthesis with
that information and create new knowledge and use that new knowledge to
transform itself so in that instance it is self
transforming but let us get back to the basic premise of the Mind and that is the mind as being at the
center of forces that flow in from the
environment it is the it is the re uh receptacle of inputs from the
environment current perceptions and evaluations and moods and the
geophysical sociopsychological circumstances influence its operations what do I mean by that I'm I simply
saying this that the very physical environment in which we
exist influences the operation of the
mind and of course we shall see as we proceed with this lecture then it is no
wonder that the European seeks to control the very living physical
circumstances under which African people must exist that these very physical
circumstances themselves help to shape and mold and influence the operation of
the African mind I often tell my students that we not only live under
certain conditions but the conditions we live under live in us we not only didn't live
under certain conditions those conditions become a concrete part of our
mind and those conditions speak through our mind and through our behavior that
is one of the reasons often it listening to people talk looking at them behave
and dress and so forth we can get a good idea of from where they come and and and
and and get a good idea of under what circumstances they have perhaps lived we
can get get a good idea of their educational and social background so
then when we live in an environment we not only exist there the environment
begins to live in us and literally uses our body as an instrument of its
expression and uses our mind as an instrument of its
expression why do you think then that the Europeans Chief tool against the
African mind and against African people is that of physical
separation is that of of redlining our neighborhoods and seeing to it that
those neighborhoods are too often deteriorated and declining in nature
those neighborhoods ultimately are reflected then in the mental operations
of African people not only then is the Mind biased
and influenced and molded by the very physical environment in which we exist but of course it is in
influenced by what I call the sociopsychological environment in which we exist that
simply means that our mind is shaped by the nature of the people we live
among this is what I mean by the nature and character of the
human interactions we have in daily life I often tell people when you move
to a neighborhood or you buy a house you're not only buying a house you're
buying a neighborhood you're buying a set of people you're buying a set of
relations and of course one of the reasons why people want to move when they are are concerned with the rearing
of their children is not only so that the children may exist in more pleasant
physical surroundings such as the house such as a neighborhood but to also
change the the human associations of their children
recognizing that these associations the relationships with neighbors and others
will also influence the character and mental development of their children and
the personality of the children so the mind is like a vast
computer it operates on its inputs and a common statement in
computer technology is garbage in garbage
out and in a sense then the computer reflects its
input and as we shall see momentarily it is through the nature of
the inputs in the African mind that European
seeks to control that mind to create its character and its
structure to create the person personality of the African
individual the mind is not only been controlled and and bias and distorted
and influenced and shaped to a degree by its circumstances and by surrounding and
environments it is also of course influenced by what is referred to as its
teleological perceptions what do we mean by that we simply mean the the mind's
view of its future the mind's view of its Destiny we
not only live in terms of our past experience and in terms of our current
current circumstances we also live in terms of what we expect to happen in the
future have often admonished our audiences that in rearing our
children we not only must rear them in terms of current
circumstances or past circumstances we must rear them in terms of the
future and it is very important that we have a view of the future and a a a
long-term view of the future when we look at our present
circumstances as African people and when we look down the road at the future we
should quickly recognize that the
tasks of the African Child are not the same as the task of
the European child and this this is this is a very
important per uh percept and it it is hooked into
education and into so many other things because we often hear black parents say
I want my children to have the same education as the white children and of course I I rail mightily
against these archaic Concepts such as same education we must get rid of that
concept equal education is another concept that we should uh get rid of
they are destroying our minds and our ability to form a true education for our
children I've often
indicated I often indicated this there's no such thing as a standard
education to a very great extent the kind of troubles we see our children in
today as the result of the fact that we have accepted European words and
definitions had seek to operate within the confines of those definitions this
of course is one of the major mean means by which war is made against the African
mind I've urged black professionals to take up the banner and take up the war
of redefinition that as long as we operate
within the definitions of Europeans then we will be subject to their
determination of our Behavior I've talked often about
European constants that is certain European programs that have not changed
since we first met the European and which are not intended to
change that The Superficial changes that we are now experiencing are only brought
into being to maintain the constancies that we must develop the
ability to look Beyond The Superficial changes and see the constancies being m
maintained by those changes we are getting ready to elect an
African mayor of this city but beware this change is still another
version of [Applause]
neocolonialism its intention is ultimately to put a black
face on white power you must recognize the intention
ultimately for the European is not to give up his power he may even Force integration upon
his people he may even elect our people to offices and so forth because in the
good old neoc colonialist fashion these people elected to offices are uh a means
by which the ultimate economic political social and other controls are
maintained so we must not see these changes as substantial and
basic changes I'm not advising you not to vote and not to put uh our African
into office but let us not be deceived during this black history month
I often advise our people that while it
is good and wonderful and fitting to celebrate our heroes and to celebrate
great events in our past we must also use this time to
meditate upon the lessons taught by those events and by those Heroes it will
do us very little good to build up a pride as a result of looking at these
Heroes and as a result of looking at our Great accomplishments if we truly do not
learn the lessons of those events and
accomplishments we must recognize that in a way we are now undergoing a second
reconstruction period that this is not the first time we have been down this road in
America those of you of course who read Leon Bennett's black power USA
are familiar with that fact I've often noted how Bennett did not finish that
book of course he then talked about what black Mayors black lieutenant Governors
black legislators black voting power black corporate leaders black men in the
Senate black men in the Congress and yet in the
1870s when Andrew Johnson changed his program when the Supreme Court changed
its program our people were disenfranchised and it took us a 100 years to get back to the
same point that we werein which means then that the people who can give are people who can
take and simply and simply because we may be voting in a black mayor doesn't
say that this is going to go on forever and ever we voted him in before and because we did not change the
basic our relationship between ourselves and the
Europeans we were disenfranchised in this context I often
warn that we are not protected by
laws we are not protected by courts we are not protected by
Presidential mandates they are but words on paper words can cannot protect your
interest the law is only as strong as those who enforce
it and the laws that now so-called protect us are written by our enemies
and enforced by our enemies and the day that they decide that they will not
enforce them the law will be null and void and they will remain neutral on the
books so that the old ultimate thing then is not laws not Civil Right laws
and rules not fire fair housing laws and rules I've told you again and again that
if there if one day the European has to choose between feeding his child and
your child I don't give a damn what law is on the books he's going to feed his
first and you may site laws and rules but the reality will be the one with the
most power is is going to be the one that rules under those circumstances so that the ultimate goal for African
people then is not the placing of laws on books nor even the election of Mayors
and governors But ultimately the building of power so that we can prevent
those who would wish to destroy us from doing so regardless of the laws they may
write regardless of the laws that may enforce or not enforce [Applause]
so when we look at the mind then as a teleological instrument is determined by
his teleological uh perceptions thank you very much and again I'm saying teleological
is just one big word for future is hooked into our word telephone
which means distance just distance that's all we were talking about here we look and we see the condition of
African people today on the bottom as Garvey noted so many
years ago everywhere he went the African man the black man is on the bottom of
the economic social and political ladder those circumstances have not
changed in many instances they are getting worse we will find if you go to buns and
Nobles and some of the others numbers of books asking can the Africans survive
are very survival into the next century is in
question I often note that our children looked at the series Star
Wars and I noticed that in the beginning of that series there were no black
people in the movie at all and I noted that whenever then the
European looks into the future there is not a black man
there they had animals robots and everything else operating rocket ships
and so forth but not a black men was there which means then ladies and gentlemen those who think that they're
in control of creating the future do not see the African man there at
all this means then ultimately if we look at the task that our children must
perform that the basic tasks of the European child is
conservative to conserve and maintain the advantages that the European already
has and to enhance those advantages so that means they rearing in
their homes in their communities that means their education
then is basically conservative because since they already
have the advantage they seek then to maintain that
Advantage when we then look at the African Child we see a very different
future and I've often said then that future is
revolutionary given the condition that our people are in today our education
cannot be then conservative if we are to save our
people from starvation if we are to remove our people from the bottom of economic political and social
ladders then we must overturn the current orders of the
[Applause]
world that in and of itself makes it very clear that they cannot receive the
same education as the white child they cannot be they cannot be reared the
same way the white child is read because they have very very different tasks to
perform it is when we recognize them the future task that our children must
perform and when we reflect on that task we then use those future uh task and
knowledge of those future tasks to reorganize our present circumstan es to
reorganize the schools to reorganize our relations one to the other to reorganize
our perception of ourselves and yay even to reorganize our history because
history is alive and history is present as I pointed out in nework of last week
history is the present and history is the future in European systems we have a
linear approach to the world an approach that makes one believe that history is
something that is Left Behind history is something that can be forgotten no ladies and gentlemen
history is never left behind in the human mind the history is now and in the
human mind the history is present for the future is made of things that were
made in the past without past there is no future and so we must
then we must then see so the the Afrocentric view of the world is
nonlinear it is one that sees past present and future as
simultaneous and we must recognize this Factor our knowledge of our history and
our perception of our history is intimately tied up with our knowledge of
our future and our ability to determine that future to forget history and not to
operate on history is not to control the future therefore we will see then those
who wish to control the African mind seek to control our perception of the
future the mind then is not only influenced by its
inputs but of course is influenced by its own nature characteristics it uses the sum of its
currently available intellectual emotional and behavioral
characteristics and it brings those characteristics to bear on its environment and to affect its that its
adaptation it uses then its own potential Powers the control of the mind and
related personality their characteristic functioning and relationships to to the
world and self- perception is significantly achieved through the
manipulation and the quantity and quality of inputs through the
structuring of its environment through the manipulation of reinforcements and
experience and the control of its perceptions and interpretation of these
inceptions uh perceptions and finally through the feedback from uh from its
output let us make it simple I only mean this then that the
Mind essentially is controlled by the nature and quality by the quantity of
information that flows into it it is also controlled by its native
characteristics by his thinking characteristics by his reasoning
characteristics by its current mood state by by its current perception of
itself and of the individuals by its current perception of the
environment and it is also controlled by its expression by its output that is
when we express something and when we act upon the world we look at the effect
of our acting upon the world how the world reacts to our action reflects back
on our mind and our mind is often changed and biased as a result of what
we call the feedback mechanism so then this gives us a basic
Insight then into how One controls the
mind you can manipulate the mind then in terms of manipulating the information
that goes in it and this is another one of the European constants I often talk
about that is hidden behind what is apparent change and that is the European
control of information which I'm sure you as an audience are very familiar
with we still fighting to get the uh videotapes of the court scene
on on like it is or on TV period you're still fighting to get
other information that you have in the toana Bry struggles and other struggles
on the public television the Europeans of course are manipulating that information despite
your election of Mayors despite your elections of Governors and so forth the
European Stills intends to control the nature of information
that is available to the African [Applause]
mind and since this mind operates on the basis of information fair to it then the
control of information by Europeans is an attempt to control the nature of the
African mind I was very happy at the time when the city son made a major coup it turned
to the to W Bry case that was
a that was a Monumental event ladies and gentlemen I
hope that you recognize the great historical value of that
situation for the first time a black newspaper I may not say the
first time but at least the first time uh in current history a black newspaper
threatened to become an authority within
itself and African and African people begin to look at a source of information
created by themselves as the source of authority and not a European
instrument because it becomes very very dangerous to the status quo when we
began to listen and follow our own authority and our own sources of
information and you can see then the New York Times as it attempted to take back
the authority that it had lost through the city Sun through either the ignoring
of that information or by this two or three page spread that it made
concerning the so-called uh grand jury findings but it had been wounded and we must
continue to wound it until it is ultimately [Applause]
destroyed information is controlled and I of to talk to college students about this one of the constants that Still
Remains with us and that is intended to remain it's what I call the control of
the domain of discourse what what does it mean it only means the control of
what it is that is important to talk about the determination of what is worth
talking about what is worth learning the European seeks then to
control this domain of discourse what is news you know the New York Times then
sees itself as what the paper record and this and that which means in a way that
it is not News until the New York Times says it's news it is not news unless it
occurs on the ma major Network anything that doesn't occur on
the major networks that does not make the entric papers then is not considered
news it is not considered worthy of learning we see this in college
catalogues I said often many of our students go go to college they look in the catalog they see the listing of
courses and they assume then that the courses listed there must be worth
knowing if they are not worth knowing and studying then they wouldn't be in the
catalog of course the adverse reasoning is if it's not in the catalog then it
must be what not worth knowing is it no coincidence then that
the things that are most pertinent to our advancement and Liberation as a people is left out of the College
Catalog he left out of the news which then suddenly creates in our minds that
news that is important to us news that is relative to us is unimportant and not
worth knowing so the very design of the catalog the very news stories that
appear in the paper the very news stories that projected on the television
set create a value system in and of themselves and the Very fact being that
certain things are are call news and other things are not then biases
information and ultimately biases the very nature of our minds and ultimately
it biases the very characteristics and capacities and abilities of our minds to
operate on that information and future information
the mind also then has some I wouldn't
say innate characteristics but at least innate
potentialities those potentialities such as reasoning logical
thinking critical analysis comparisons
contrasting evaluative stuff these these kinds of
things calculating weighing measuring looking at cause and effects
looking at relations abstracting those characteristics are
the very operation the Mind uses to to uh operate on the world itself to
operate on information to transform information to synthesize information to
store information to compare information to use information that is ultimately
projected in behavior and ultimately projected on the
environment a mind then that cannot look at implications and develop implications
a mind then that cannot perform simple syllogistic reasoning a mind that cannot
perform comparisons the mind that cannot contrast the mind that cannot calculate
weight and measure a mind that it cannot determine causes and effects a mind that cannot
determine relationships a mind that cannot perform organization a mind that
cannot perform planning a mind that cannot evaluate its effect upon the world is a mind then that has no real
influence upon the world and is a mind that has lost control of itself and is a
mind that cannot protect the interest of the personality and the person in which it is a
part this type of mind this type of structuring is the result to a good
extent of the nature of the inputs of the mind and is a nature then as I said
earlier of the kind of conditions under which the Mind operates and lives and
exists one of the reasons then our children
have problems often in in their thinking skills and reasoning
skills as aside here I'll say in for a moment that we as people can only be in
the condition we are in as a result of being robbed of our common
sense as a result of being robbed of our thinking
skills as a result of being emotional and not
reasonable so that our Behavior can come under the control of reason and logic
under the control of critical analysis of possibilities and probabilities it is necessary for the
European in order to control the African mind to emotionalize that mind and if
you'll note the ad on TV and radio and the other propaganda appeals to which we
are subjugated time in and time out are designed to speak directly to the
emotions not to the rationality of the individual you can only hypnotize an
individual once you get around his critical analytical thinking and the African then is often
emotionalized as a Prelude to his uh behavioral
manipulation so then we it is no accident that our children are placed
with it in certain schools or as I said earlier that we are forced to live under
certain uh psychological and physiological
circumstances for it is the it is supposedly in the schools and in the
institutions that these inherent characteristics and potentialities of
the Mind are developed it is supposedly in the schools that thinking skills and
reasoning skills and comparative skills and implicative skills and other skills
are trained and developed in the mind so that the mind then can operate
autonomously and independently in the world and bring then the world under its
will and under its subjugation and protect the individual in and the
environment and if necessary from the
environment but a thinking black man and woman is a dangerous black man and
woman I have to tell you again and
again that all of the institutions of the
society I don't care whether you're talking about the family institution the so-called criminal
justice institution the so-called religious
institution the health institutions the educational
institutions The Economic Institutions all of
them have one thing in common and and that is maintaining European
domination and I have said often and I will say again that is the reason why
when you meet those institutions they will operate in relationship to you in a
way that is the very opposite of what their name implies and I've said again and again
that the church will often send you to hell that the economic system will keep
you poor that the health system will keep you
sick that the that the justice system will met out injustice how else can it maintain the
European Empower if the institutions don't do
it and I'm surprised by how often we are surprised as to why our children are not
learning in these schools we don't
understand in order for us to be in the condition we're in we must literally be
turned backwards as a people we must be reversed because this world can only be
ruled in terms of Lies a when you have a minority of
people a 10% of the world's population a 10% of the world's population whose
lands are not inherently wealthy whose lands have no natural
resources ruling over the other 90% then that other 90% must be kept out
of its mind that other 90% must exist in a state of deception that other 90% must
live there in in a reversed situation and in a backward situation therefore
that another 90% must accept the lie as truth and the truth as
[Applause]
lies I've said that the major differentiation between eurocentric
oriented psychology and afro centrically oriented psychology under oppression
is that it is a political necessity that the black man be out of
his mind it is not merely the result of the interaction you had with your mother
or your father it is not merely the the result of the absence of your father in
the home or the absence of role models in your communities or all of these other things we hear day in and day
out it is not merely the result of that it is ultimately the result of the need
for the European to maintain power and domination and these things are but an
effect of that need you had two Sundays ago a bunch of negroes trying to explain
the disparity between the education of black females and black
males a pathetic situation
pitiful they went to Yale went to the University of
Chicago the experts that they had what set up and of course those experts gave
them the answers that they wanted to hear and then they're presented to
African people as experts if but they if they they gone to
the people themselves I'm sure they would have got a different set of names and a different set of people but those
people did not appear in that paper so we get people putting effects as
causes you see oh it's the absence of the black male model in the
neighborhood but how does the absence of the black male model occur why is it
necessary for that absence to be there that is never dealt with and discussed
it never gets around so you have a bunch of experts uh discussing secondary
situations and the situations and making them appear to be major that is why
they're teaching at the University of Chicago in Yale because those institutions are just
as much and and more of a part of European domination as any other
institution and yet we we we say that they give us a good
education and we talk and we feel so good when we send our children there
without any African Consciousness they are being sent there to be
destroyed so then we'll we'll we we have to then look at the
schools because it is in the schools it is in the colleges and
universities that the black man and woman the black child the black boy and
girl must be taught to be dumb that is the purpose of the
schools let us recognize it if the European can only exist to the
extent that we are not in control of our common sense that we are not in control
of our identity that we are not in control of a shared Collective activity
level if the European can only exist and dominate as a result of the fact that we
are not in in love with ourselves and with our
people if the European can only be in control as a result of the fact that we
have not fully developed our technological thinking capacities and the ability to concretize those
capacities then why do you think those abilities and those personality character istics are going to be taught
in European oriented schools it doesn't make any sense the European is not going to teach his enemy to overthrow him and
yet some of us think that that will be the case there is hardly any African in
the world that is ever given a European education you know we hear some people
talk about well he has a white mind or he thinks like white folk black
people are not taught to think like white folk you can sit in the white University as long as you want to you'll
never be taught to think like a white man you can even learn the same thing in
terms of of of uh course content as the white boy and girl the white student you
can learn it even better you can come out Summa Ki and you still have not received the white
education no sir you got a negro education no matter way you go in the
system I wouldn't complain I often tell people you know who thinks
more like a white man if you want to use those terms I'm
putting those in parenthesis a faran yeah yes how do we say that because you
see if you're taught to think like a white man like white people you want your own Nation that's what white F WR
[Applause] you'd want to own your own
neighborhoods that's the way white folk think you'd want to control your own
economy that's the way white folk think you'd want to have your own Army that's
the way white folk think ladies and gentlemen these people going to these colleges don't think like white folk
they don't come out determined to control their Destiny they don't come out determined to create their own
Nations and places in the world they don't come out determined to control military strength and economic strength
and other strength they are coming out the same way their slave great grandparents came out that is to be
servants and to be highly educated
servants that is why a Faron frightens them because they see themselves in a
Faron who says I don't want to sleep with your women I don't want to marry women I don't want to live among you
I don't have anything to do with you you're dirty rotten and regressed as a people you represent a destructive force
in the world and we are going to remove you from power and we are here to see that your influence on the world ceases
and is put to an end we're here to take rightful control of the wealth that is
under the lands of our people and take rightful control of our of our minds
we're here to put you in your 10% place in the world itself [Applause]
they see that where are you getting that kind of
education in the yalees and Harvard and yet ladies and gentlemen that's the only kind of education that's worth
anything I've often said there that the function of education is not to get jobs
and all this other baloney you here every day
secondary secondary the ultimate function of
education is to secure the survival of a
people what good would it do you to know Computer Engineering and all the other stuff if you can be blown away at any
moment by another people if you're manipulated by another people if the
other people continue to maintain the instruments uh and the power of production what does it mean to have
knowledge when AIDS can be let loose on the African Community and destroy our
communities knowledge is not enough knowledge must be welded to purpose it
must be welded to a sense of peoplehood it must be welded to a sense
of Destiny and that is when it becomes protective of a people you may fill your
head with knowledge and skills all you want to but you can be destroyed by AIDS
and all other kinds of germs and all other kinds of warfare and lethal weapons and all other kinds of
controlled instruments that the European has in this power until that knowledge
and education is welded to a sense of nationhood you are not receiving a good
education at all and therefore a good education must be measured in terms of
the degree to which it protects your survival and interest as a people and
not [Applause]
otherwise so then we see an attempt then in the European
school to distort and to [ __ ] the
potentialities of the African mind and the education is designed to do that and
you say to yourself well okay but I know some people who think technologically and this and that and they got through
you know course we can say a lot about that but let us just note
this sure you you know some people who are very important at Nasa who have uh
made great instruments perhaps uh that uh have flown out on the space shuttle
and all of this kind of stuff great but look at the nature of that
knowledge and look to where that knowledge is applied and to whose benefit it is
applied before you get too happy about it the chief thing that happens when the
African person educated in entric schools does manage to maintain a
mathematical mind a highly logical brilliant mind is often that that mind
is alienated in the sense that it is
permitted to maintain its logical and other functions
only at the price of separating that individual emotionally socially and
culturally from his or her people so that the knowledge so that the
Knowledge and Skills cannot be used in the interest of of the people but in the
interest of the enemy as we often say when one is alienated so that one uh
capacities and ability can only be used for whose benefit the benefit of
aliens that's the source of strangers of people other than ourselves that is the
reason why have said often that the more degrees we get in Business
Administration the fewer businesses we have to administer that is the reason I've said
often that you there is almost a uh monotonal relationship between the
number of blacks and African-Americans receiving degrees in economics and the
number of Korean businesses on 125th
street it's no strange coincidence then that as we get more and more mbas out
here we get more and more Korean businesses on under 25th Street a that a strange situation paradoxical but it's
really not that paradoxical we've noted here now that on on 125th Street there
are approaching 70 Korean businesses on that street you try to name me 20 black
ones on that street and yet there are 95 95% of the people on that street that
shop on that street of black people African-Americans where are the
mbas where are the phds in economic who went through the won School of
Finance where are those people with knowledge because the knowledge is
alienated it cannot work for African people it can only work for the other
people so don't be so proud of yourself because you might have got through MIT
and you may be a mathematical genius see where and how you can apply that genius
in the interest of the survival of African people if you cannot do so then you have been alienated and you have
become a part of your own [Applause]
oppression so we can see then this mind is controlled by the nature of of its
inputs and in light of time I'm going to have to move on here but I wanted to
look at a few things to indicate just just how intimately related the nature
of the mind is and how much the mind is biased by the nature of inputs those of
you uh who've gone in Psychology uh who've taken psychological courses
perhaps have run across the chapter on sensory deprivation where the in where person is
deprived of his sensory contact with the world where you can be put into a
sensory deprivation tank some of you might have seen the movie last week uh a
couple of weeks I think it was last week of so-called Altered States where the and and that movie
across is based on current psychological research where people are put in tanks
and where the environment is made to reduce their sensory
input so they can hear little or nothing they can feel little or
nothing they often lose sense of their own body in a sense try to imagine what
would happen if you lost your sense of hearing and if you lost your sense of
sight on top of that and in addition to that you lost your sense of touch you
lost your sense of smell you lost your sense of taste you
lost even the sense of of feeling your own body when you get into that state then
your mind begins to do peculiar things a similar state to that is a
state that we undergo each night when we sleep and dream dreaming is a form of
hallucinating wherein as we shut down our senses and connections to the
external world the mind in sense is left to run free and it creates then its own
world and those of you who uh youve undergone nightmares and other kinds of dreams can see that that world can be
fantastic and amazing and sometime it can be so vivid until you don't know
that you're out of reality until you wake up and you can confus in the
hallucination that the dream represents with reality and often then people who will
put in these this uh desensitization tanks or cens deprivation tanks uh must get out
immediately or soon thereafter because they start hallucinating they start having strange feelings their mind
starts paying tricks on them and so forth and it becomes a punitive experience it means then that the Mind
maintains its balance and maintains its characteristics and maintains its
Consciousness and control of its of its processes by the connections that
maintains with the environment and by the quality nature of inputs into it and
if these are distorted if these are cut off if these are biased if these are
evaluated in the wrong sort of ways if these are put in the wrong context or
different context the Mind reflects this biasing and Distortion and and
qualitative changes and we must then recognize that
we we let another people write our history and let another people furnish our information we let another people
interpret reality and defined reality we have been letting that other people determine to a good extent the character
and the operational nature of our minds that is why of course black
history African history has been written the way it is written and I'm going to come back to
that in a minute I just want to look at another thing for here for a quick second some of you may get a chance to
read uh the introduction to um to Michael Hutchinson's Mega
brain which is a very uh fascinating book uh and so of course those of you in
Psychology have run across some of that information before there is uh he talks about a
series of experiments there that are classic in psychology
ology those experiments of course was done with the old classical rat but they they are of some
interest a psychology psychologist back in the
1920s uh noticed that some rats were better running maze than other
rat mazes than other rats and of course what he did then was
to select what he saw as maze bright rats
and Ma dull rats separated those rats and had them reproduce so that he
developed a genetic strain of smart rats and dull
rats you see by re continuing to reproduce they then passed on a the
genetic characteristic of brightness of dullness as far as mazes were
concerned and interesting situation here again trying to control the breeding
characteristics of rats and of course that's not too UNAM in our own history
controlling of breeding characteristics uh a number of
psychologists then wondered if these Rats the bright rats
and the dull rats Run The Mazes differently do they then have a
different chemistry brain chemistry and I'm emphasizing this
chemistry because often we think that words are just sounds and I try to get across again and again that words are
more than sounds words are physical words and are caus physical
changes in the brain each time you hear words each time you perceive something
each time you experience something chemical electrical and other changes
take place in your brain there are physical changes that occur in the brain
itself so these psychologist reason then that uh if these rats are dull and if
they are if some of them are bright then they must have a different brain
chemistry so they then look at the brain chemistry of these two rats these two
sets of rats and they notice then that these these uh rats had differ levels of
a brain enzyme referred to as acetal cholin neas we won't go into exactly what that
is it's an enzyme though that is the result of certain um neuronal activities
an enzyme that controls the effects of uh of various other chemicals
on the neurons themselves each time we behave each time time we think there is
a transference from one nerve cell that makes up our brain of a chemical to
another nerve cell and this chemical when it impacts upon the receiving nerve
cell and on on receiving hundreds of thousands of nerve cells has an effect
on the way we behave have an effect on what we do on how we think and how we
feel there are other chemicals that are necessary then to control these effects
so colon acetal colon esteras is one of those chemicals then that can that turns
on and off that regulates then the effects of those chemicals that are passed between neurons and that are
ultimately responsible for Learning and other forms of behavior these psychologists then found that rats that
the rats with higher levels of acetal colon esterases learn better than those
with low levels the maze bright rat had higher level of acetal choline necessay
than ma do so that their very brain chemistry was different now the
psychologist then went on further to reason that if the brain chemistry
between bright rats and dull rats is different can we then manipulate the
chemistry of these rats and the brain chemistry of these rat by manipulating
the environment of these rats so of course many of you are familiar with this then
what these psychologists did were to place three groups of rats from the same
genetic background let us say they took the maze bright rats one set of rats who had the
same genetic potential put them in three different environments in a so-called standard
laboratory environment in a so-called impoverished environment and in in
enriched environment they then after to placing these animals in this environment
remember now they have essentially the same genetic potential they're all maze
bright rats after placing them in these different
environments it was noted that the chemistry in the brains of these rats
reflected the environment under which they existed in other words those rats
which started out on an equal basis genetically who had been exposed to the
enriched environment where they had greater challenges greater stimulative
uh challenges where they had a varied environment and so forth had higher
levels of acetal choline esteras than the other rats that were raid in in
raised in the standard environment and raised in the impoverished environment in other words the very chemical nature
of the brain was regulated by controlling the very environment and the
Very sensory input into the brains themselves the very nature of the inputs
from the environment in which those rats live determined the chemical nature of
their brains and let us I can't go into it in detail because of the time Factor here
but I'll point out one other thing that the experiments showed very clearly that not only did the chemical nature of the
rats brains reflect the conditions under which they live but the very physical
nature of the brains reflected the character the uh environments under which they live their actual brain
weight changed the actual number of connections
between neurons increased the actual number of synapses
which is those parts of the cell that are interconnected and a part of the communication networks with other cells
increased many other aspects of the brains were transformed physically and
chemically as a result of the experience under which those rats had lived under
the influence of the nature of the information that they had received and
they had gone into their very uh Minds it was shown found that the weight and
chemistry of these rats could be changed in uh when they were in old age
that is they took rats that were the equivalent of 75 year olders and 90 year
old human beings and and and these rats brains were made to change chemically as
well as physically as a result of being exposed to varying information and
varying environments so they indic ated then that the brain is eternally plastic and
that its ability to operate and process information to control Behavior to
manipulate the environment to control itself is intimately related to the
quality of U information put into the brain itself I I don't have time to read
this piece those of you who want to look at uh last uh this Tuesday's New York
Times uh science section and I urge that you read this section if you don't read any other section read the science
section in the New York time on Tuesdays on uh one of the pages there
they talk about test hint drug May in
invigorate on uh one of the pages there they talk about test hint drug May in
invigorate the older brain and they talk about then a drug that was used to to uh
um to deal with stroke has also been shown to
reinvigorate the uh learning capacities of older adults and that adults who were treated
for stroke with these drugs also rediscovered their memory and learning
uh and their past learnings which indicates again then that to change the nature of the chemistry of the brain is
to change the very nature of our uh to change the very nature of its
intellectual capacities and ultimately of its intelligence now let us get back
in the light of this then what I'm telling you uh in simple terms then that
the control and manipulation of the environment under which we live as a people the control
and manipulation of the school environment the control and manipulation
of information the control and manipulation of definition the control and
manipulation of reality is a control and manipulation of our minds and a control
and manipulation of our very physical brain and a control and manipulation of
the very chemical nature of this brain and ultimately a control of our minds as
such that is why we cannot let the European any longer control information
and any longer control this world and it no longer Define the nature of the universe
in let us look then at the writing of African history and I will Ur urge you
perhaps to check with African echos and perhaps they can uh set up some kind of
relationship African Echo located there in New York last week I did U and
address in terms of European history and its effects and I talked about
history uh in the psychological sense I talked about history in terms
of social Amnesia and the fact that Amnesia is seen as a pathological state
in abnormal psychology and how then being disconnected from one's history being
disconnected from one's culture is to be put in a state of
amnesia and therefore to be put in a state of of pathology we then looked at the nature
of that Amnesia and I'll just quickly list a
number of the effects and results of our not being in touch with our history
because too many of us are made to think history is something that you learned about the past and history is something
about dates I started that address off by indicating
that the very fact that history in the United States is projected as something
that is irrelevant is projected as something that is not economically relevant that
it is a series of dates and events in an of itself is an attempt to manipulate
our mental nature this Society does not project an
image that does not work in its interest
jacobe in the book called soci Amnesia stated exactly because the past is
forgotten it rules unchallenged I tried to demonstrate in that uh addressed last
week that simply because you forget your history simply because you don't know
your history does not mean you have escaped its effects as a matter of fact
it is more effective to the degree that you're ignorant of
it it is the absence of knowledge of history that permits history to more
effectively control current behavior that the African youngster in
school today is more effectively controlled by the slave experience of
African people because that youngster does not know of that experience than otherwise and therefore keeping our
children from a knowledge of that experience is only to subject them to deeper control by our historical
experien of of people I tried to then indicate that Amnesia
then the social Amnesia by the absence of knowledge of our history by letting
our history be manipulated by another people means that our life is determined
by fear anxiety Terror and Trauma when you run away from your
history you must run away from it for a reason you must run away from it because you're ashamed of it you must run away
from from it because it creates anxiety in your mind you must run away from it because it terrorizes and traumatizes
because it makes you angry and therefore you repress the knowledge and refuse to know it but the problem is then the
Terrors and the anxiety becomes the means by which one is manipulated so the very absence of the
knowledge of History means that we are controlled by the fears of that knowledge and therefore the personality
Falls under the control then of fear and anxiety and consequently we become
pathological our Behavior then becomes one that is determined by
avoidance rather than by affirmation so social Amnesia then does
not get us away from the effects of History it puts up us under the negative effect and pathological effects of
History I indicated then that social and eia means that the individual operates
on the basis of denial so we have Bunches of African people operating and
defining themselves and relating to other African people on the basis of denying who they are and denying their
history so life is lived negatively life is lived in terms of escape and
everything they are about is the escape of their history and of
themselves and and you see when when when you're made to fear yourself when
you're made to fear your history when you're made to De when you're made to to
devalue your culture when you're made to devalue your your your your experience
then you come under the control of fear and Terror and life becomes determined
by a constant attempt at denial life becomes determined by a constant attempt
at escape and one of the major reasons then our people are subjected to the use
of drugs and subjected to the use of alcohol and narcotics is that those
drugs and narcotics Aid them in denying reality and denying and escaping their
history and and their themselves so if forgetting of History
dist starts once perceptions of the universe and makes one blind it leads
then to self-alienation and ultimately to self-destruction because whether you
know your history or not it is a part of yourself and to repress that history is
to separate you from yourself and you can only be alienated
to the degree that your your personality has been split into it is only in the
vaccuum created by being split from history and culture that a new identity
is in projected into the African mind and the African being becomes possessed
by another identity I have often stated
then one of the key steps in brainwashing and recreating a
personality is to First separate that personality from the ground of his history experience and background
it is no accident then that the we were separated from our culture we may look
then at the slave Camp not only as a camp that's used that that was designed
to exploit our labor but as a camp that was cheaply designed to reorient and
reconstruct our personality as African people to not only use us as servants
but to inculcate and inject into our very bodies and Minds a servants
mentality so that after the inculcation in introjection of that personality we
could then be emancipated and be again given Freedom a
freedom which means that we are only free to do the wrong
[Music]
thing we are given a freedom of choice because the mentality has been set up in
such a way that we will always make the choice that works against our interest and it's been designed and set
up that way that's right but in order for that to occur we must have first
been separated from our African identities and an emptiness and a vacuum
created so that we could suck in the new identity and that identity then could
take control of our bodies we are possessed by demons we are possessed by
a demon interjected into us by a demonic people and as you
saw and as you saw in the movie The Exodus and it's so amazing we sit in
these movies and are entertained and don't see the insults that these movies
represent and don't learn the lessons that these movies teach the easist is a
supreme lesson in introjection and demonology the demon then gets into the
body and literally uses that body and manipulates that body the demon only
serves its creator when you let then another people
create personality when you let another people create reality when you let
another people separate you from your identity and yourself when you let another people give you a name when you
let other people that you deal with the world in terms of the names they've given the world they have injected a
spirit and a demon into the personality and that demon only responds to their
call the very the very appetites of that demon the very tastes of that demon the
very thing it desires how those things which abuse the body in which it is a
host and Desto the body it hungers for unhealthy things it hungers to take
destructive things because it has no concern about the body it inhabits its
purpose is to work against that body and to use that body in service of its Masters and of his
creators this introjection then of the spirit can only OCC her as the result of
a separation from the identity uh from our African identity and identity with
ourselves and so this is what social Amnesia does the rewriting of History
then is set up as a means of separating us from ourselves so a new identity can
be injected so I want you to understand then that history is not just about
knowledge and facts and information and about time and so forth it is intimately
tied up to who you are and what you are how you see the world and experience yourself as a person social amnia then
means that the life is based on negation versus affirmation life is unintegrated
and misunderstood when you don't know your history then you don't know the source of your
motivations you are azzle to yourself you start asking yourself why did I do
that why do I behave the way I do or you hear some of us say why do we act like
we do one of the curious things about human nature is the very experiences that
create our personality are the very experiences we don't remember the personality essentially is
formed by age two two and a half how many of us can remember in detail the
experiences we had from birth to 2 and A2 and yet it is those experiences
during that time period that pretty much makes us who and what we are as a people
so then so then our absence of memory of that period does not mean that that
period is not manipulating and controlling our Behavior as a people it means then that the very way we
behave and the Very basis for the way we behave is inaccessible to us then we
don't know why we behave as we do when a people then rob you of your knowledge of
history and culture your own motivations and behavior then become a puzzle to
yourself and you cannot then engaged in self- understanding or the understanding
of the universe that's surround you motivation is puzzling and uncontrolled when then we're separated from our
history and yet that history is the basis of our motivations then those
motivations control us those motivations become habits and we then become weak in
the face of those motivations and we find ourselves in creatures of habits rather than creatures of Reason rather
than creatures of wisdom when we are then uh put into social Amnesia by
having our history controlled in forgetting our history we forget and misinterpret the history of others and
their motivation I indicated that you cannot deeply understand African history
without deeply understanding the history and psychology of the European it is
through the understanding of yourself that you understand the psychology of your
enemy from history we assume the wrong identity and we identify with our enemies we are given identities by
others we lost we lose a sense of shared identity and Collective response I must
run through this we forget the debt that we owe to the past and future
Generations we we then Mis misinterpret our accomplishments as our own individual accomplishments I of to say
to college students don't you think that you're in these European colleges simply because you are so smart or you come
from the right families or you made the right SAT scores and all that other nonsense you're
told Africans have always been from the right families they've always had the
intelligence they've always uh but despite all of these things they were
not admitted into these schools so you're not here as a result of your great intellectual skills we've always
had that you're here because a people put their lives on the line made sacrifices
and so forth to get you here and you owe those people a
debt but without a knowledge of that history and without a knowledge of their
sacrifice and with this bogus view that you're here because you're smart you
then do not repay that debt you become a ready servant for the other people not
only though do you not pay the debt for the people who made the sacrifices because youve forgotten that history you
forget the debt that you owe to those coming behind you you then don't come concerned about
the school politics and other things you just want to get your credits get out and make a big
when then these schools decide that they want to put you out it would be those same people you must call on to keep you
in therefore you cannot forget that history we cannot plan for the future
without a past I talked about this situation and I wish I could talk about it today of where people were hypnotized
in their past was removed and the behavior that re occurred as a result of
having their past removed the psychologists then told them they had no future and and they had a different
Behavior the psychologist then told them that they had no present and a different Behavior occur what are we saying then
ladies and gentlemen the manipulation of History has concrete results on Behavior
has concrete effects upon the world history as I said earlier is a
grid it it is a set of coordinates by which an individual deter his place and
position in the world and places himself in space and
time and therefore a people who have forgotten history and the people who are not concerned with the future are the
people who have lost their orientation are the people who have a sense of meaninglessness a sense of
purposelessness a people then who are manipulated by current fads and current
Fashions not a people whose behavior is determined by purpose and by a sense of
destiny that is the reason why history is Rewritten not only just to Rob us of
facts and information but is a mean of controlling the future intellectual
structures and powers are undeveloped and restricted our talents are alienated
I showed uh in that lecture in thei Prior week how through the forgetting of
our history we actually have lost economic power
I showed how Africans on the continents by recalling African tradition were able
to raise and are able to raise large sums of money to finance their
businesses how they are able to get away from eurocentric Banks I come to tell
you ladies and gentlemen there's no such thing as a black bank that Banks reti black economic
progress is it little wonder that freedom National Bank sitting on 125th
Street let uh 70 Korean businesses inhabit that street while black
businesses cannot flourish there what good is freedom and Cara
doing us sitting on that street if they cannot establish businesses and economic development over there it is because
they are not ours they are institution of foreign powers it does not matter if they are
black people in it as long as they are regulated by the federal government and regulated by European tradition and
history they belong to Europeans and not to African
people and therefore you put your money in them and that money is used to
finance your enemies and to finance highways and to finance factories and to
finance all kinds of warfare and other kind of stuff going on in the world and when you try to repair your house or
your landlord tries to repair your building you a Redline so the very money that you put into the bank are not even
have made available to for your own [Applause]
use we could do without them we have to have our own
Banks Banks that are not regulated by federal the federal
government and and we can do it looking that African tradition we we I I showed where there
were Africans in in the cameroons who who were able to lend each other as much
as a million dollars a month by the knowledge of African
tradition and African psychology the African-American because he's amnestic
about African tradition even though he's theight the richest nation on Earth cannot use his wealth to create his own
economic system don't tell me then that history is irrelevant to Economic Development it is
all a part and partial of Economic Development why do you think the people rob you of it if it doesn't work to the
economic Advantage so we must look again then at amnesia amnesia means then an
Undiscovered self an emptiness a self incapable of self- understanding aelf
that is incapable of understanding its own motivations a self incapable of self-direction and
self-determination a reactionary self a self that does not understands others of
the world in which it exists a feralis externalized self let's then wrap it
up and I just want to show again we're still talking about the theme of how One
controls the Mind by controlling input by controlling the development of its
potential characteristics such as reasoning and thinking and so forth by controlling its
outputs our children are destroyed for instance by the fact that when they make
a brilliant answer they're met with a Stony silence or they're not
rewarded the Mind looks at that situation and says well when I make a brilliant statement the teacher seems
unhappy the teacher seems uninterested the teacher seems annoyed
then I had better what stop making them the mind then reflects back on itself
and begins to make itself dumb begins to turn itself off begins to restrict its
behavioral possibilities and retards its own development the individual then
becomes functionally [ __ ] in the sense that there is nothing organically wrong with the brain
but the person is behaving as if the brain has been damaged when you let another people then be in
control of the reinforcements be in control of the AIDS and the bees and the Seas be in control
of the scholarships be in control of the various rewards then those people then
control the expressions of your children and those expressions are fed back to
your children's mind and the children literally then recreate themselves in the image of those who control the
reinforcements
and so we see the European on both sides of this mind on the front end
controlling its input and on the back end controlling the effects of its output and then squeezing the mind in
between destroying it and restricting it and ultimately bringing that mind under
control when it does not utterly destroy it and kill it and make it
dead then in summary the struggle for control of the African mind and
personality should be obvious from what I have said if we as African people are going
to get control then of the African mind and personality it means then that we must
get control of the input to our own minds we must get control of how the
mind's potential is developed and we must get control of the effects
of the output of the mind of the African mind it means then that we must engage
in self-creation as a people when you can control what goes in your mind when you
can control the nature of development of the characteristics of your mind when
you can control the effects of your mind's output in the world then you're
engaged in self-creation I've often said then that we as soall African people today or as
negro people if I in a better sense today are a created people a
Frankenstein people a people put together by the program and intentions
of another people and it is as the result of another people having control
over input development and the effects of output we see it in the Skinner rat
where that rat is put into a situation and its whole personality and capacities
are controlled by having its situation controlled what does that mean then
ultimately ladies and gentlemen it means that we even move Beyond a knowledge of History we move even Beyond a sense of
Pride and that's wonderful and those things are wonderful we must ultimately go for the real God goal and that goal
is power that goal is real concrete solid
power the capacity to control if the if as I said earlier the mind can be biased
and distorted by the very physical environment in which one lives then it
means if we are to gain control as African people we must control then what the very physical environment under
which we live as a people if it can be controlled by the very nature of the information fed into the African mind
then if Africans are to gain control of their own mind they must gain control of what the information that's fled into
that mind if it is controlled by the evaluation of that information by the very context of that
information then if we to get control of ourselves we must control then the evaluation and the context of that
information it means ultimately that we must control these schools in the
profound sense of the word I have said often the education of the African Child
is education in search of an African rationale and in search of an African
theory of Education one of the major reasons why we are caught in the the
confusion that we are caught in today about the education of black children is because we do not have an African theory
of Education that African theory of Education must come out of the organic
ground of African experience when you see then what your children have been
robbed of what kind of personalities must be missing in order for this
Society to be controlled the way it is controlled when you see that it is necessary that thinking skills must be
robbed from black children when you see that it is necessary that the ability to identify themselves as African must be
robbed from of from African children when you see that it is necessary that
these children do not like themselves and reject their history when you see
that it is necessary that they have problems loving their opposite member
when you see that it is necessary that they have problems in conceptual thinking and abstract thinking and so
forth you will then recognize what the curriculum of the education of your children must be
when you see then how these characteristics are robbed of the
personality and how it is accomplished then there's an implicit educational program in that not looking at the way
other people educate their children not looking at the way they do it somewhere else the education of children must come
out of the ground and experience of African people so don't tell me history is a set of events and and dates and so
forth history your very life it is through the the understanding of history that an educational theory is developed
then you know exactly how long you want to teach you know exactly what you want to teach you know exactly where you want
to go you know you want to get rid of these standardized tests you know you want to get rid of these reading exams
who told you as I say often that your children must know the same thing at the same time at the same point that the all
the children know it to take these standardized tests and so-called achievement tests is a way of letting
the other group determine the nature and content of the education of your children you cannot say then that you've
been through a slave experience a Jim Crow experience a scandalizing experience of your history and of your
personality and then assume that you can just throw your children in a entric designed system and they are just going
to come and learn the same thing at the same time that the other children
learn when are you going to when are you going to then inculcate
within your educational system a therapeutic and other kind of
model that gets them over this kind of destruction of their mind and concept of
themselves so that then they can move forward in the development of their academic and intellectual skills so it
means that what we do with our children in the first two three or four or five years of their life cannot be what the
European is doing to his job in those first years of his life get rid of standard education get rid of the
concept of equal education it is not about that so ultimately then the strategy for
the regain of the control of the African mind means the recapturing of the African
identity you are African you're African you are African you cannot Escape
it you can hide behind abstractions and all other kind of games but you cannot
Escape it that's at the very center of your intellect culture is not just the way
people behave not just the way people dress not just the way people eat not
just the way people dance not just the way people make music not just a
superficial history of a people culture ultimately is an intellectual
tool it is an intellectual structure when a culture is passed on from the
mother to the child and from the parent to the child an intellectual structure is passed on to that child because the
culture determines how the world is to be perceived the culture determines how the world is to be organized the culture
determines how the world is to be processed the culture determines how the world is to be attacked the culture
determines how the world is to be evaluated how it is to be weighed and measured so therefore when you pass on a
culture you're passing on on an intellectual frame of reference that can be used to compare to contrast to see
causes and effects to see relations to plan to organize and so
forth and therefore when you rob your children of your identity when you rob them of their history and Rob them of
their culture you rob them of their minds and that is why have it written the way we have it today so ultimately
if you want to get back in your minds and recapture control of your mind and recapture control of your destiny and
recapture the control of your lands and the economics and so forth you must first recapture your African identity
thank you very much
